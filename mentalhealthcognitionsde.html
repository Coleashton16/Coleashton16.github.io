This includes visual agnosia, where a client cannot recognize familiar objects or, in severe cases, familiar faces or even their own reflection. Aphasia is loss of language, and apraxia is loss of purposeful movement.",

Decreasing stimuli reduces sensory input that can fuel the hallucination, and engaging in a concrete, reality-based activity (like folding towels) helps distract the client and focus their attention away from the internal stimuli.",

A firm, neutral, and matter-of-fact restatement of the expectation (the limit) is the most therapeutic approach. It avoids getting into a power struggle and reinforces the structure the client needs. Exploring feelings is often ineffective as they have a profound lack of empathy and remorse.",
