Beta-adrenergic blockers are less effective for the control of hypertension in African Americans unless combined with a diuretic. B. ACE inhibitors are less effective for the control of hypertension in African Americans unless combined with a diuretic. D.

In patients with preexisting bronchospasm or other pulmonary disease like COPD, nonselective beta blockers can cause bronchoconstriction due to unopposed parasympathetic tone, making it a relative contraindication. A, B, C. Metoprolol, Atenolol, and Bisoprolol are cardioselective beta1 blockers, meaning they primarily act on the heart and are less likely to cause bronchoconstriction. While cardioselectivity does not confer absolute protection, they are generally preferred over nonselective beta blockers in patients with pulmonary disease."

        "rationale": "C. Orthostatic hypotension is a common and troublesome side effect of antihypertensive agents in older adults, who often have a slower sympathetic nervous system response. Instructing the client to rise slowly from lying or sitting to a standing position allows the body more time to adjust to the change in position and prevent blood pooling in the lower extremities, thereby reducing dizziness and the risk of falls. A. Increasing fluid intake may be appropriate in some cases but is not the primary intervention for orthostatic hypotension caused by antihypertensives and could be contraindicated in conditions like heart failure. B. Taking medication with milk is not a general recommendation for preventing orthostatic hypotension and may interfere with absorption of some medications. D. Isometric exercises are not a standard intervention for preventing orthostatic hypotension and could potentially worsen it if not done correctly."

Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can decrease the effect of ACE inhibitors like captopril and may also increase the risk of renal dysfunction when taken concurrently with ACE inhibitors.

Beta blockers should not be used by patients with sinus bradycardia or second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block. Administering the medication could further decrease the heart rate to a dangerously low level. The nurse's priority is to notify the healthcare provider immediately for further instructions. A, B. Administering the medication without consulting the provider would be unsafe given the bradycardia. D. Rechecking the pulse in 30 minutes delays necessary intervention and does not address the immediate concern of administering a bradycardia-inducing drug to a client who is already bradycardic."

Beta blockers are frequently prescribed with arteriolar vasodilators to decrease the heart rate and counteract this effect. A. Diuretics are given with vasodilators to decrease peripheral edema caused by sodium and water retention, not reflex tachycardia. B. ACE inhibitors primarily block the RAAS and do not directly address reflex tachycardia in this context. D. Calcium channel blockers also promote vasodilation and can cause reflex tachycardia (especially nifedipine), so they would not be used to counteract this effect."

Salt restriction (e.g., to 2400 mg daily) is a key nonpharmacologic intervention for hypertension. E. Smoking cessation is crucial for overall cardiovascular health and helps decrease BP. D. Decreased alcohol ingestion, not increased, is a nonpharmacologic method to lower BP.
