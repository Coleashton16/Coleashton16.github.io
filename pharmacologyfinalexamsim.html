      "C": "Absorption",
      "D": "Distribution"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "rationale": "Absorption is the process by which a drug moves from its site of administration into the bloodstream. Metabolism is the breakdown of the drug, excretion is its elimination, and distribution is its movement throughout the body.",

    "questionText": "A patient is prescribed a medication that is known to have a very narrow therapeutic index. Which nursing action is the highest priority for this patient?",

      "A": "Educating the patient about potential side effects.",
      "B": "Monitoring the patient for therapeutic and toxic effects.",
      "C": "Administering the medication with food to reduce GI upset.",
      "D": "Checking the drug's half-life in a drug reference book."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "rationale": "For drugs with a narrow therapeutic index, the difference between a therapeutic dose and a toxic dose is small. Therefore, close monitoring for both therapeutic and toxic effects is the highest priority to ensure patient safety.",
    "section": "Pharmacokinetics",
    "type": "mc"

  {
    "questionText": "A patient develops a rash, fever, and joint pain after starting a new antibiotic. The nurse recognizes these as unexpected and undesirable effects that indicate a need to stop the medication. This is an example of a(n):",

      "A": "Side effect",
      "B": "Adverse reaction",
      "C": "Drug toxicity",
      "D": "Therapeutic effect"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "rationale": "An adverse reaction is an unintended, undesirable, and often unpredictable effect of a drug at a normal dose. Side effects are predictable and often unavoidable secondary effects. Drug toxicity refers to severe adverse effects due to excessive dosing or accumulation. Therapeutic effect is the desired effect.",
    "section": "Pharmacodynamics",
    "type": "mc"
  },
  {
    "questionText": "A nurse administers an oral pain medication to a patient at 0900. The medication's peak effect is known to occur 2 hours after administration. When should the nurse plan to reassess the patient's pain level to evaluate the drug's maximum effectiveness?",

    "correctAnswer": "C",

      "C": "Just before the next scheduled dose.",
      "D": "Midway between two doses."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "rationale": "Trough drug levels are drawn just before the administration of the next dose to measure the lowest concentration of the drug in the bloodstream. This helps ensure the drug remains within the therapeutic range without accumulating to toxic levels.",

      "C": "Full agonist",
      "D": "Inverse agonist"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "rationale": "A full agonist binds to a receptor and produces a maximal response, effectively mimicking the effect of an endogenous ligand. A partial agonist produces a weaker response, an antagonist blocks a response, and an inverse agonist produces an effect opposite to that of a full agonist.",

      "A": "Garlic supplements are generally safe and can be taken with warfarin.",
      "B": "You should stop taking warfarin if you plan to use garlic supplements.",
      "C": "Garlic can increase the risk of bleeding when taken with warfarin, so consult your provider.",
      "D": "Garlic will decrease the effectiveness of warfarin, making your blood thicker."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "rationale": "Garlic is known to have antiplatelet properties and can increase the risk of bleeding when taken concurrently with anticoagulant medications like warfarin. The patient should always consult their healthcare provider before combining herbal supplements with prescribed medications.",
    "section": "Drug-Nutrient Interactions",
    "type": "mc"

      "D": "Monitor for signs of increased heart rate."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "rationale": "Drug-induced photosensitivity is a heightened reaction to sun exposure caused by a medication. The most important instruction is to avoid sunlight, wear protective clothing, and use high-SPF sunscreen to prevent severe sunburn.",

    "questionText": "A patient asks the nurse about using complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for chronic pain. Which important points should the nurse discuss with the patient? Select all that apply.",

      "A": "CAM therapies are always safe because they are natural.",
      "B": "It is important to inform your healthcare provider about all CAM therapies you are using.",
      "C": "Some CAM therapies can interact negatively with prescribed medications.",
      "D": "CAM therapies are regulated by the FDA in the same way as prescription drugs.",
      "E": "Evidence of effectiveness for CAM therapies varies widely."
    },
    "correctAnswer": ["B", "C", "E"],
    "rationale": "Patients should always inform their healthcare provider about CAM use due to potential drug-herb interactions. CAM therapies are not always safe simply because they are natural, and their effectiveness varies. The FDA does not regulate CAM therapies (especially herbal supplements) with the same rigor as prescription drugs.",
