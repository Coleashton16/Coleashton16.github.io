        "correctAnswer": "B",
        "rationale": "The patient's cancer, combined with severe hyponatremia and concentrated urine, strongly indicates SIADH. In SIADH, excess ADH causes water retention, leading to a dilutional hyponatremia and an excess fluid volume state. The neurologic symptoms are a result of this imbalance.",

        "correctAnswer": "C",
        "rationale": "Severe hypernatremia creates a hyperosmolar state in the blood, pulling water out of brain cells via osmosis. This cellular shrinking leads to neurologic manifestations like confusion, lethargy, and potentially coma. Cerebral edema (A) is a risk with severe HYPOnatremia.",
        "section": "AVP-D / Diabetes Insipidus"

        "correctAnswer": "C",
        "rationale": "Excess cortisol in Cushing's syndrome causes significant sodium and water retention. This hypervolemia can overwhelm the heart's pumping ability, leading to fluid backup in the lungs (pulmonary edema), which directly impairs gas exchange and presents as fluid volume excess.",
        "section": "Cushing's Syndrome"

        "correctAnswer": "B",
        "rationale": "The most immediate life-threatening sign is the tall, peaked T-waves, which are a classic ECG finding for severe HYPERkalemia (a hallmark of Addison's disease). The nurse must confirm this electrolyte imbalance immediately as it can lead to fatal dysrhythmias. While other actions are important, confirming the cause of the ECG change is paramount.",

        "correctAnswer": "B",
        "rationale": "The names are confusing for patients. The best response clearly and simply differentiates the two conditions: Diabetes Insipidus is a disorder of water balance (ADH/Vasopressin), while Diabetes Mellitus is a disorder of glucose metabolism (insulin).",

        "questionText": "A patient with Addison's disease develops an adrenal crisis. How does this condition impact tissue perfusion?",
        "options": {"A": "It causes hypervolemia, leading to bounding pulses.", "B": "It causes profound hypotension, leading to poor tissue perfusion and shock.", "C": "It causes peripheral vasoconstriction, leading to hypertension.", "D": "It causes hyperglycemia, which impairs oxygen's ability to bind to hemoglobin."},
        "correctAnswer": "B",
        "rationale": "Adrenal crisis results in severe hypovolemia from the loss of aldosterone and cortisol. This leads to profound hypotension and circulatory collapse (shock). Without adequate blood pressure, tissue perfusion is severely impaired.",

        "correctAnswer": ["A", "C"],
        "rationale": "AVP-R is characterized by the kidneys' inability to concentrate urine. This results in the excretion of large volumes of urine (polyuria) that is very dilute, meaning it will have a low urine osmolality and a low specific gravity (e.g., < 1.005). B, D, and E describe the opposite condition, SIADH.",

        "correctAnswer": "A",
        "rationale": "While B and C contribute to the risk, the primary reason is the direct immunosuppressive effect of high cortisol levels. Excess cortisol reduces the number of circulating lymphocytes, inhibits macrophage activity, and suppresses the overall inflammatory response.",
