An aPTT of 120 seconds is significantly above the therapeutic range (typically 1.5-2.5 times the control, or 30-85 seconds, depending on the lab's baseline) and indicates an increased risk of hemorrhage. This requires immediate intervention, likely stopping the infusion and notifying the provider. B. A platelet count of 95,000/mm³ is below the normal range (150,000-450,000/mm³) and could indicate heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), a serious adverse reaction requiring immediate cessation of heparin. D. A hemoglobin of 8.5 g/dL is low (normal male: 13.5-17.5 g/dL; female: 12.0-15.5 g/dL) and suggests active bleeding, which is a major adverse effect of heparin. This requires immediate investigation and intervention. C. A PTT of 50 seconds is within or close to the lower end of the therapeutic range (60-70 seconds) for heparin, indicating a less urgent concern compared to the other options. E. INR is used to monitor warfarin therapy, not heparin. This value is irrelevant for heparin monitoring.",

For acute, significant bleeding, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or whole blood transfusion is often indicated for a more rapid reversal of anticoagulation. A. Phytonadione does not provide immediate reversal; its onset of action is delayed. C. Phytonadione is specifically indicated for bleeding due to warfarin toxicity. D. While oral vitamin K can be used for less severe elevations in INR, for acute bleeding, it is typically given intravenously slowly.",

Patients taking LMWHs should be instructed not to take antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin due to the increased risk of bleeding. D. Bleeding is a major adverse effect of anticoagulants; patients must be taught to recognize and report signs such as excessive bruising, petechiae, tarry stools, or hematuria. E. LMWHs produce more stable responses at recommended doses, making frequent laboratory monitoring unnecessary and allowing for home administration. A.

Thrombolytics, or 'clot busters,' are designed to attack and dissolve blood clots that have already formed, thereby reestablishing blood flow to ischemic tissues and minimizing necrosis. A. Preventing new clot formation is the primary role of anticoagulants. B. Inhibiting platelet aggregation is the primary role of antiplatelet drugs. D.

Ginkgo biloba is an herbal product known to interfere with platelet aggregation and can increase bleeding risk when taken with anticoagulants. D. Phenytoin is a highly protein-bound drug that can displace warfarin from its protein-binding sites, leading to increased free-circulating warfarin and an elevated bleeding risk. E. Large, inconsistent intake of green leafy vegetables, which are rich in Vitamin K, can fluctuate the client's vitamin K levels, making INR control difficult and potentially decreasing warfarin's effectiveness if intake is increased, or increasing bleeding risk if intake is suddenly decreased after a period of high intake. A. Acetaminophen is generally recommended as an alternative to aspirin for pain relief in clients taking warfarin because it does not significantly increase bleeding risk in the same way aspirin does.",
