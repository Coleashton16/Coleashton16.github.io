During a follow-up visit, the nurse notes the client's blood pressure is well-controlled, but the client reports increased joint pain and stiffness, especially in the great toe. Which laboratory result, if noted by the nurse, would most likely explain the client's new symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Serum Potassium: 4.1 mEq/L",
      "B": "Serum Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL",
      "C": "Blood Glucose: 115 mg/dL",
      "D": "Serum Uric Acid: 9.8 mg/dL"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "rationale": "D. Serum Uric Acid: 9.8 mg/dL is significantly elevated. Thiazide diuretics, such as hydrochlorothiazide, are known to cause hyperuricemia by blocking uric acid excretion. Elevated uric acid levels can precipitate gout attacks, which commonly affect the great toe and cause severe joint pain and stiffness. A. Serum Potassium: 4.1 mEq/L is within the normal range (3.5-5.0 mEq/L), indicating that the client's potassium levels are currently stable, although thiazides can cause hypokalemia. B. Serum Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL is within the normal range, indicating adequate renal function, which is necessary for thiazide effectiveness. C. Blood Glucose: 115 mg/dL is slightly elevated but not indicative of a critical or acute problem explaining the joint pain; thiazides can cause hyperglycemia but this level is not a primary concern for acute gout symptoms.",

      "B": "Aspirin 81 mg daily",
      "C": "Gentamicin",
      "D": "Warfarin"

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "rationale": "C. Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic, and aminoglycosides are known to be ototoxic. When combined with loop diuretics like furosemide, the risk of ototoxicity (hearing impairment) is significantly increased. This requires careful monitoring. A. Metformin is an antidiabetic medication and does not have a known interaction with furosemide that increases ototoxicity. B. Aspirin (even low dose) can have renal toxicity with thiazides, but it is not primarily associated with increased ototoxicity when combined with furosemide. D. Warfarin is an anticoagulant; furosemide is highly protein-bound and can displace other protein-bound drugs like warfarin, increasing bleeding risk, but not ototoxicity.",

The nurse identifies that the client is also taking lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, for hypertension. Which assessment finding would be of **most** concern to the nurse and require immediate action?",

      "D": "Urine output 700 mL in 24 hours"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "rationale": "C. Serum Potassium: 5.8 mEq/L is indicative of hyperkalemia (normal: 3.5-5.0 mEq/L). Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic, and ACE inhibitors (like lisinopril) also increase serum potassium levels. The combination of these two drugs significantly increases the risk of severe, life-threatening hyperkalemia, which can lead to dangerous cardiac dysrhythmias. This requires immediate intervention. A. Blood pressure 118/72 mm Hg is within a desirable range, indicating effective antihypertensive therapy. B. Serum Sodium: 135 mEq/L is within the normal range (135-145 mEq/L). D. Urine output 700 mL in 24 hours is adequate (should be at least 600 mL/day for potassium-sparing diuretics), indicating effective diuresis without severe renal impairment.",

      "C": "Serum sodium level of 140 mEq/L.",
      "D": "Urine output of 45 mL/hour."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "rationale": "B. The presence of fine crackles in bilateral lung bases indicates pulmonary edema, a severe adverse reaction to mannitol due to rapid fluid shifts. Mannitol is contraindicated or must be used with extreme caution in patients with heart disease and heart failure, and should be immediately discontinued if the patient develops HF or renal failure. A. Blurred vision is a known side effect of mannitol but not an immediate contraindication requiring questioning the order. C. A serum sodium level of 140 mEq/L is within the normal range and does not contraindicate mannitol administration. D. A urine output of 45 mL/hour is an adequate output and does not indicate a contraindication; mannitol is used to promote diuresis.",

Hydrochlorothiazide is a potassium-wasting diuretic, so increasing intake of potassium-rich foods helps prevent hypokalemia. C. Photosensitivity is a side effect of thiazides, so using sunscreen and protective clothing is important. D. Muscle weakness and leg cramps are signs and symptoms of hypokalemia, a common side effect of thiazide diuretics, which should be reported immediately. E. Thiazides can cause hyperglycemia, so diabetic clients need to monitor their blood glucose more frequently.",

The nurse understands that furosemide is chosen over a thiazide diuretic for this client primarily because of which characteristic?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Furosemide has a longer duration of action, promoting sustained diuresis.",
      "B": "Furosemide causes less electrolyte imbalance compared to thiazides.",
      "C": "Furosemide is effective in patients with severe renal dysfunction.",
      "D": "Furosemide promotes calcium reabsorption, preventing hypocalcemia."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "rationale": "C. Furosemide (a loop diuretic) is frequently prescribed for patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 30 mL/min and for those with end-stage renal disease because its effectiveness is maintained even with severe renal dysfunction. Thiazide diuretics are greatly decreased in effectiveness if creatinine clearance is less than 30 mL/min. A. Furosemide has a shorter duration of action (6-8 hours PO, 2 hours IV) compared to thiazides (6-12+ hours). B. Loop diuretics are extremely potent and cause marked depletion of water and electrolytes, often leading to more significant electrolyte imbalances than thiazides. D. Loop diuretics cause excretion of calcium, unlike thiazides, which inhibit calcium loss and can cause hypercalcemia.",

The combination of these two drug classes can lead to severe or life-threatening hyperkalemia, necessitating close monitoring of serum potassium levels. A. While serum sodium should be monitored (hyponatremia is possible), hyperkalemia is a more immediate and life-threatening concern with this drug combination. C. Blood glucose should be monitored due to the hydrochlorothiazide component, which can cause hyperglycemia, but it is not the most immediate life-threatening concern in this specific drug interaction. D. Serum calcium can be affected by hydrochlorothiazide (hypercalcemia), but the interaction with the ACE inhibitor primarily impacts potassium.",
