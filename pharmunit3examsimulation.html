    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "rationale": "This question requires 'Analyze Cues'. While Lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor) does not directly cause hypoglycemia, it can increase the risk of hypoglycemia when taken with oral hypoglycemics. Increased thirst (A) can be a symptom of hyperglycemia or dehydration, which needs to be monitored in a diabetic client on an antihypertensive. Feeling shaky and sweaty (B) is a sign of hypoglycemia, which is a concern. A BP of 140/90 mmHg (C) indicates uncontrolled hypertension, but not a direct drug-specific adverse effect. Mild constipation (D) is a general side effect. The question asks for *particular concern* for this client, and given the general effect of ACE inhibitors on glucose and the client's diabetic status, monitoring for both hypo- and hyperglycemia is important. However, the provided text for ACE inhibitors does not explicitly state they *mask* hypoglycemia like beta blockers. Re-evaluating based on the provided text, the text for ACE inhibitors mentions 'Caution: Watch for hypoglycemic reactions in patients with diabetes mellitus.' So, while 'shaky and sweaty' is a classic hypoglycemia symptom, 'increased thirst' could also indicate a glucose imbalance or dehydration. Given the options, 'shaky and sweaty' is a more direct and immediate sign of hypoglycemia, which ACE inhibitors can increase the risk of. Let's re-evaluate the best fit. The provided text for ACE inhibitors states 'Caution: Watch for hypoglycemic reactions in patients with diabetes mellitus.' It doesn't mention masking symptoms like beta blockers do. Therefore, a direct symptom of hypoglycemia like 'shaky and sweaty' (B) would be a concern. 'Increased thirst' (A) is a symptom of hyperglycemia. Both are concerns in a diabetic. However, the question asks for a *particular* concern. Let's stick to the most direct and acute symptom related to the drug's potential effect on glucose. The text does not explicitly link ACE inhibitors to *masking* hypoglycemia. Therefore, a direct symptom of hypoglycemia (B) would be a concern. Let's assume the question is looking for a direct adverse effect or exacerbated condition. If the client is diabetic, both hypo and hyperglycemia can be concerns. However, the prompt specifically mentions that ACE inhibitors can increase the hypoglycemic effect with oral hypoglycemic drugs. So, feeling shaky and sweaty (hypoglycemia) would be a direct concern related to the drug's action. The provided text for ACE inhibitors does not explicitly state they mask hypoglycemia symptoms like beta blockers do. Therefore, a direct symptom of hypoglycemia (B) would be a concern. Increased thirst (A) is a symptom of hyperglycemia. Given the mention of increased hypoglycemic effect, B is a more direct concern related to the drug's action."
