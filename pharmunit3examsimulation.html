    "options": {
      "A": "Assessment of joint pain level using a pain scale.",
      "B": "Review of the patient's dietary intake of purine-rich foods.",
      "C": "Evaluation of kidney function tests (BUN, creatinine) and liver enzymes.",
      "D": "Checking the patient's blood pressure and heart rate."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "rationale": "Allopurinol is metabolized in the liver and excreted by the kidneys. Renal impairment can lead to drug accumulation and toxicity, while liver dysfunction can impair its metabolism. Therefore, monitoring kidney function tests (BUN, creatinine) and liver enzymes is crucial before and during therapy to ensure safe administration and prevent adverse effects. While other options are relevant to gout management, they are not the most critical pre-administration assessment for drug safety.",

      "A": "Heartburn or indigestion",
      "B": "Swelling of the ankles or feet",
      "C": "Black, tarry stools",
      "D": "Increased urine output",
      "E": "Shortness of breath"
    },
    "correctAnswer": ["B", "C", "E"],
    "rationale": "Celecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, carries a black box warning for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal risks. Swelling of the ankles or feet (B) and shortness of breath (E) can indicate fluid retention and potential cardiovascular issues (e.g., heart failure exacerbation). Black, tarry stools (C) are a sign of gastrointestinal bleeding, a serious adverse effect of NSAIDs. Heartburn or indigestion (A) is a common but less severe GI side effect. Increased urine output (D) is generally not an expected adverse effect.",
    "section": "Pain/Inflammation and Analgesics"

    "questionText": "A nurse is providing discharge teaching to a patient prescribed low-dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection. Which statement by the patient indicates a need for further education?",
    "options": {
      "A": "\"I should take this medication with food or milk to reduce stomach upset.\"",
      "B": "\"I will avoid taking ibuprofen while I'm on aspirin.\"",
      "C": "\"If I experience ringing in my ears, I should call my doctor.\"",
      "D": "\"I can take extra aspirin if I have a severe headache or muscle pain.\""
    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "rationale": "Taking extra aspirin (D) beyond the prescribed low dose for cardiovascular protection can significantly increase the risk of adverse effects, particularly gastrointestinal bleeding and salicylate toxicity (manifesting as tinnitus). Patients should not self-medicate with additional aspirin. Options A, B, and C are correct instructions: taking with food/milk reduces GI upset, ibuprofen can interfere with aspirin's antiplatelet effect, and tinnitus is a sign of salicylate toxicity requiring medical attention.",

      "B": "Peripheral edema",
      "C": "Elevated blood pressure",
      "D": "Increased appetite",
      "E": "Gastrointestinal bleeding"
    },
    "correctAnswer": ["B", "C", "E"],
    "rationale": "Long-term use of NSAIDs like ibuprofen can lead to several significant adverse effects. Peripheral edema (B) and elevated blood pressure (C) are due to fluid retention and cardiovascular effects. Gastrointestinal bleeding (E) is a well-known and serious risk. Constipation (A) and increased appetite (D) are not typical adverse effects of ibuprofen.",

    "questionText": "A patient asks the nurse about using complementary and alternative therapies for chronic back pain. Which response by the nurse demonstrates appropriate patient education?",
    "options": {
      "A": "\"You should stop your prescribed pain medication and try herbal remedies instead.\"",
      "B": "\"Complementary therapies are not scientifically proven and should be avoided.\"",
      "C": "\"It's important to discuss any complementary therapies with your healthcare provider before starting them, especially if you are taking other medications.\"",
      "D": "\"Only therapies like acupuncture are effective for chronic pain.\""
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "rationale": "Patient education regarding complementary and alternative therapies should emphasize safety and informed decision-making. It is crucial for patients to discuss these therapies with their healthcare provider (C) to ensure they are safe, appropriate, and do not interact negatively with existing medications or medical conditions. Options A, B, and D provide unsafe, dismissive, or overly restrictive advice.",

  {
    "questionText": "A nurse is educating a patient about acetaminophen. Which statement indicates the patient understands the most important safety consideration for this medication?",
    "options": {
      "A": "\"I can take as much of this as I need for my pain, as it's very safe.\"",
      "B": "\"I need to be careful not to take other medications that also contain acetaminophen.\"",
      "C": "\"This medication will reduce inflammation in my joints.\"",
      "D": "\"I should take this medication on an empty stomach for better absorption.\""
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "rationale": "The most important safety consideration for acetaminophen is the risk of hepatotoxicity (liver damage) with overdose. Many over-the-counter cold, flu, and pain medications contain acetaminophen, and patients can inadvertently exceed the maximum daily dose by taking multiple products. Therefore, avoiding other acetaminophen-containing medications (B) is crucial. Acetaminophen does not significantly reduce inflammation (C). It can be taken with or without food (D). Option A is incorrect as exceeding the recommended dose is dangerous.",

  {
    "questionText": "A patient is prescribed morphine sulfate for severe postoperative pain. Before administering the medication, the nurse should prioritize assessment of which vital sign?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Blood pressure",
      "B": "Heart rate",
      "C": "Respiratory rate",
      "D": "Temperature"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "rationale": "Morphine sulfate is an opioid analgesic that can cause respiratory depression, a potentially life-threatening adverse effect. Therefore, assessing the patient's respiratory rate (C) before administration is the highest priority to ensure patient safety. While blood pressure (A) and heart rate (B) can also be affected, respiratory depression is the most critical and immediate concern.",
    "section": "Pain/Inflammation and Analgesics"
  },
  {
    "questionText": "A nurse is administering nalbuphine to a patient experiencing moderate pain. The nurse understands that nalbuphine is an opioid agonist-antagonist. What is a key advantage of this type of opioid compared to a pure opioid agonist like morphine?",
    "options": {
      "A": "It has a longer duration of action, requiring less frequent dosing.",
      "B": "It produces less respiratory depression at equivalent analgesic doses.",
      "C": "It is more potent than morphine, providing stronger pain relief.",
      "D": "It does not cause physical dependence or withdrawal symptoms."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "rationale": "Opioid agonist-antagonists like nalbuphine have a 'ceiling effect' on respiratory depression, meaning that beyond a certain dose, they do not cause further respiratory depression, making them safer in terms of this specific adverse effect compared to pure opioid agonists (B). They still can cause physical dependence (D) and their potency (C) and duration of action (A) vary but are not their primary advantage over pure agonists.",
    "section": "Pain/Inflammation and Analgesics"
  },
  {
    "questionText": "A patient presents to the emergency department with a severe migraine headache. The nurse anticipates administering a medication that targets specific serotonin receptors. Which drug class is typically used for acute migraine treatment?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Beta-blockers",
      "B": "Calcium channel blockers",
      "C": "Triptans",
      "D": "NSAIDs"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "rationale": "Triptans (C), such as sumatriptan, are serotonin receptor agonists specifically designed to treat acute migraine headaches by causing vasoconstriction of cranial blood vessels and inhibiting inflammatory neuropeptide release. Beta-blockers (A) and calcium channel blockers (B) are often used for migraine prophylaxis, not acute treatment. NSAIDs (D) can help with mild to moderate migraines but are not the primary targeted therapy for severe migraines.",
    "section": "Pain/Inflammation and Analgesics"
  },
  {
    "questionText": "A nurse is caring for a patient receiving a broad-spectrum antibiotic. The nurse understands that broad-spectrum antibiotics are most appropriate in which clinical situation?",
    "options": {
      "A": "When the specific causative pathogen has been identified and its sensitivities are known.",
      "B": "For treating viral infections that do not respond to antiviral therapy.",
      "C": "In situations where a rapid empirical treatment is needed for a severe infection before culture results are available.",
      "D": "As a first-line treatment for all minor bacterial infections to prevent resistance."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "rationale": "Broad-spectrum antibiotics are effective against a wide range of bacteria (both Gram-positive and Gram-negative). They are most appropriate for empirical treatment of severe infections (C) where rapid intervention is necessary and the specific pathogen is not yet identified. Once culture results are available, therapy should be narrowed to a more specific antibiotic (A) to prevent resistance. They are not used for viral infections (B) and their overuse for minor infections (D) contributes to antibiotic resistance.",
    "section": "Antimicrobial Drugs"
  },
  {
    "questionText": "A patient with a penicillin allergy is prescribed an antibiotic. Which antibiotic class should the nurse question due to potential cross-sensitivity?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Macrolides",
      "B": "Aminoglycosides",
      "C": "Cephalosporins",
      "D": "Tetracyclines"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "rationale": "Cephalosporins (C) have a chemical structure similar to penicillins, leading to a risk of cross-sensitivity, especially in patients with a severe penicillin allergy (e.g., anaphylaxis). While the risk is generally low (5-10%), it's crucial to assess and potentially avoid cephalosporins in such cases. Macrolides (A), Aminoglycosides (B), and Tetracyclines (D) do not share this cross-sensitivity.",
    "section": "Antimicrobial Drugs"
  },
  {
    "questionText": "A nurse is monitoring a patient receiving intravenous vancomycin. Which assessment findings would indicate a potential adverse reaction to the medication? (Select all that apply)",
    "options": {
      "A": "Redness and flushing of the neck and upper body",
      "B": "Elevated serum creatinine levels",
      "C": "Reports of ringing in the ears",
      "D": "Increased urine output",
      "E": "Mild diarrhea"
    },
    "correctAnswer": ["A", "B", "C"],
    "rationale": "Vancomycin is associated with several significant adverse effects. Redness and flushing of the neck and upper body (A) are characteristic of 'Red Man Syndrome,' which can occur with rapid infusion. Elevated serum creatinine levels (B) indicate nephrotoxicity, a dose-related adverse effect. Reports of ringing in the ears (C) suggest ototoxicity, another potential adverse effect. Increased urine output (D) is not a typical adverse effect; rather, decreased output might indicate nephrotoxicity. Mild diarrhea (E) can occur but is less specific to vancomycin's serious adverse effects compared to the others.",
    "section": "Antimicrobial Drugs"
  },
  {
    "questionText": "A patient is prescribed ceftriaxone. The nurse knows that this medication is a third-generation cephalosporin. What is a key characteristic of third-generation cephalosporins?",
    "options": {
      "A": "They are primarily effective against Gram-positive bacteria.",
      "B": "They have excellent penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).",
      "C": "They are commonly used for treating Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).",
      "D": "They are associated with a high risk of nephrotoxicity."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "rationale": "Third-generation cephalosporins, like ceftriaxone, are known for their improved activity against Gram-negative bacteria and their ability to penetrate the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) effectively (B), making them suitable for treating meningitis. They are not primarily effective against Gram-positive bacteria (A) compared to earlier generations, and they are not typically used for MRSA (C). While all antibiotics can have adverse effects, they are not specifically known for a high risk of nephrotoxicity (D) compared to, for example, aminoglycosides.",
    "section": "Antimicrobial Drugs"
  },
  {
    "questionText": "A nurse is administering an aminoglycoside antibiotic. Which lab values are most important for the nurse to monitor due to the potential for serious adverse effects? (Select all that apply)",
    "options": {
      "A": "Serum potassium levels",
      "B": "Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine",
      "C": "Liver enzymes (ALT, AST)",
      "D": "Peak and trough drug levels",
      "E": "Complete blood count (CBC)"
    },
    "correctAnswer": ["B", "D"],
    "rationale": "Aminoglycosides are known for their nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Therefore, monitoring kidney function through BUN and creatinine (B) is crucial. Additionally, therapeutic drug monitoring with peak and trough levels (D) is essential to ensure efficacy while minimizing toxicity, as these drugs have a narrow therapeutic index. While other labs might be monitored in a general assessment, B and D are most pertinent to aminoglycoside-specific adverse effects.",
    "section": "Antimicrobial Drugs"
  },
  {
    "questionText": "A patient is prescribed clindamycin. The nurse should instruct the patient to report which severe adverse effect immediately?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Headache",
      "B": "Metallic taste in mouth",
      "C": "Severe watery diarrhea with abdominal cramping",
      "D": "Mild skin rash"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "rationale": "Clindamycin is notably associated with a high risk of Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD), which can range from mild diarrhea to severe, life-threatening pseudomembranous colitis. Therefore, severe watery diarrhea with abdominal cramping (C) must be reported immediately. While headache (A), metallic taste (B), and mild skin rash (D) can occur, they are generally less severe than CDAD.",
    "section": "Antimicrobial Drugs"
  },
  {
    "questionText": "A patient is prescribed a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. The nurse should include which important safety instruction in the patient's education?",
    "options": {
      "A": "\"You should take this medication with antacids to prevent stomach upset.\"",
      "B": "\"Avoid prolonged exposure to sunlight or use protective clothing and sunscreen.\"",
      "C": "\"This medication can cause your urine to turn orange.\"",
      "D": "\"You may experience significant muscle weakness, but this is a normal side effect.\""
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "rationale": "Fluoroquinolones are associated with photosensitivity, increasing the risk of severe sunburn. Therefore, advising patients to avoid prolonged sun exposure and use protective measures (B) is crucial. Antacids (A) can chelate fluoroquinolones, significantly reducing their absorption, so they should be avoided or taken several hours apart. Orange urine (C) is associated with rifampin, not fluoroquinolones. While muscle weakness can occur, especially related to tendon issues, it is not a 'normal' side effect and should be reported.",
    "section": "Antimicrobial Drugs"
  },
  {
    "questionText": "A nurse is reviewing a patient's culture and sensitivity report. The report indicates that the bacteria causing the infection is 'resistant' to several common antibiotics. What is the most appropriate nursing action based on this finding?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Administer the prescribed antibiotic, as resistance reports are not always accurate.",
      "B": "Notify the healthcare provider immediately to discuss alternative antibiotic choices.",
      "C": "Increase the dose of the prescribed antibiotic to overcome the resistance.",
      "D": "Continue to monitor the patient's symptoms without changing the medication."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "rationale": "If a culture and sensitivity report indicates resistance, the prescribed antibiotic will likely be ineffective against the infection. The most appropriate nursing action is to notify the healthcare provider immediately (B) so that an alternative antibiotic to which the bacteria is sensitive can be prescribed. Administering an ineffective antibiotic (A), increasing the dose (C), or continuing to monitor without change (D) would delay effective treatment and potentially worsen the patient's condition.",

  {
    "questionText": "A patient with stable angina is prescribed sublingual nitroglycerin. The nurse provides patient education on its use. Which instructions are essential for the nurse to include? (Select all that apply)",
    "options": {
      "A": "Take one tablet every 5 minutes for chest pain, up to three doses.",
      "B": "Place the tablet under the tongue and allow it to dissolve.",
      "C": "Swallow the tablet whole with a glass of water.",
      "D": "Seek emergency medical attention if pain is not relieved after the first dose.",
      "E": "Store the medication in a cool, dark place in its original container."
    },
    "correctAnswer": ["A", "B", "E"],
    "rationale": "Sublingual nitroglycerin is taken for acute angina attacks. The correct administration is to place it under the tongue (B) and allow it to dissolve. The standard protocol for chest pain is to take one tablet, wait 5 minutes, and if pain persists, take a second dose. If pain still persists after another 5 minutes, take a third dose and call 911 (A). It should not be swallowed (C). Seeking emergency medical attention after the *first* dose if pain is not relieved (D) is too premature; the patient should wait for the second and potentially third dose before calling 911. Nitroglycerin is sensitive to light and heat, so it must be stored properly (E).",

    "questionText": "A nurse is assessing a patient prescribed digoxin. Which assessment finding would require the nurse to withhold the medication and notify the healthcare provider?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Apical pulse of 72 bpm",
      "B": "Blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg",
      "C": "Serum potassium level of 3.0 mEq/L",
      "D": "Urine output of 60 mL/hour"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
