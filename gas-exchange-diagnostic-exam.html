        "correctAnswer": "C",
        "rationale": "According to the text, 'Chemoreceptors in the medulla sense carbon dioxide levels, and when carbon dioxide concentration is elevated, these receptors transmit impulses to the diaphragm and intercostal muscles to contract.' Low oxygen levels are the stimulus for breathing only in specific chronic conditions.",

        "correctAnswer": "D",

        "options": { "A": "Ventilation", "B": "Transport", "C": "Perfusion", "D": "Diffusion" },
        "correctAnswer": "B",

        "rationale": "The text explicitly warns, 'Patients whose pulmonary disease causes retention of carbon dioxide, such as those with COPD, should not use oxygen levels greater than 3 L/min unless necessary... giving these patients oxygen can eliminate their stimulus to breathe.' A simple face mask at 6 L/min delivers approximately 35%-50% oxygen, which is well above the recommended limit for these clients.",

        "correctAnswer": "B",
        "rationale": "The text states, 'Infants are at risk because they have fetal hemoglobin. Fetal hemoglobin is present for the first 5 months of life and results in shortened survival of erythrocytes, causing physiological anemia by age 2 or 3 months.'",

        "correctAnswer": "D",
        "rationale": "The text states a pH less than 7.35 indicates acidosis. A normal PaCO2 is 35-45 mm Hg. When the PaCO2 level increases, the pH decreases, indicating acidosis. 'Respiratory acidosis develops during hypoventilation when carbon dioxide is retained.' The client's pH is low and PaCO2 is high, with a normal HCO3, indicating uncompensated respiratory acidosis.",

        "correctAnswer": "A",
        "rationale": "The text states that antihistamines 'block the histamine1 receptors to cause vasoconstriction' and are used for allergic rhinitis symptoms, not for acute bronchospasm in asthma. Lower airway bronchodilators like sympathomimetic agents (β2 agonists) are used to relieve bronchospasm. This statement indicates a misunderstanding of the medication's purpose.",

        "correctAnswer": "C",
        "rationale": "The text explains, 'For older adults, diminished strength of respiratory muscles reduces the maximal inspiratory and expiratory force. This may result in a weaker cough.' A weak cough combined with immobility from bed rest significantly increases the risk for atelectasis and pneumonia.",
