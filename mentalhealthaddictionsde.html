        "rationale": "The client's symptoms (confusion, ataxia) are classic signs of Wernicke's encephalopathy, a precursor to the amnestic Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. The text states that replacement therapy with thiamine (vitamin B1) can prevent this neurodegenerative disorder. Administering glucose-containing fluids without prior thiamine can worsen the condition by depleting the remaining thiamine stores.",

        "correctAnswer": "B",
        "rationale": "Lorazepam, a benzodiazepine, can cause CNS and respiratory depression. A respiratory rate of 10 indicates significant depression. The priority is patient safety, which involves withholding further doses of the causative agent and immediately notifying the provider. Administering more lorazepam would be dangerous. Naloxone is for opioid reversal, not benzodiazepines. Simple documentation is insufficient for this level of respiratory depression.",

Therefore, the client's consumption is close to, but still below, the weekly threshold for 'at-risk' drinking.

        "rationale": "The classic triad of opioid overdose (intoxication) is CNS depression (stupor), respiratory depression (bradypnea), and pupillary constriction (miosis/pinpoint pupils). Heroin is an opioid. Stimulants would cause mydriasis (dilated pupils) and tachycardia. Hallucinogens cause reality distortion.
