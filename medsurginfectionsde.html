    "questionText": "A 78-year-old client with a history of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is admitted with a suspected systemic infection. The nurse notes the client is afebrile, but reports new onset confusion, anorexia, and increased fatigue. The client\u2019s latest arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.29, PaCO2 58 mmHg, HCO3 24 mEq/L, and PaO2 70 mmHg. Considering the client's comorbidities and current presentation, which immediate action by the nurse is most appropriate?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Administer a prescribed as-needed dose of an antipyretic to address potential masked fever.",
      "B": "Prepare to administer a bronchodilator and assess breath sounds for worsening COPD exacerbation.",
      "C": "Initiate continuous pulse oximetry and prepare for oxygen therapy titration.",
      "D": "Anticipate orders for blood cultures and broad-spectrum antibiotics, recognizing atypical sepsis presentation.",
      "E": "Collaborate with the dietitian to increase caloric intake to combat anorexia and fatigue."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "rationale": "The client's presentation (new confusion, anorexia, fatigue) in an older adult with chronic illnesses, despite being afebrile, is highly indicative of an atypical septic presentation. The ABG results show respiratory acidosis with hypoxemia, which can be a consequence of severe infection and hypoperfusion. The most immediate and appropriate action is to prepare for definitive diagnosis (blood cultures) and treatment (broad-spectrum antibiotics) for sepsis, as delayed treatment significantly increases mortality. Antipyretics are not indicated as the client is afebrile and the issue is not fever management. While respiratory compromise is present, addressing the underlying systemic infection is the priority. Nutritional support is important for chronic management but not the immediate priority for an acute, potentially life-threatening infection.",

    "questionText": "A nurse is reviewing the electronic health record of a 45-year-old client admitted to the intensive care unit with severe sepsis. The client's current vital signs are BP 82/40 mmHg, HR 128 bpm, RR 30 breaths/min, SpO2 90% on 4L nasal cannula, and temperature 38.9\u00b0C. The nurse notes a recent laboratory result showing a serum lactate level of 4.2 mmol/L. Which five findings, when considered together, present the most significant and immediate concern for the client's deteriorating status?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Tachycardia, tachypnea, fever, hypoxemia, and elevated lactate.",
      "B": "Hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxemia, elevated lactate, and fever.",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "rationale": "The combination of hypotension (BP 82/40), tachycardia (HR 128), hypoxemia (SpO2 90%), elevated lactate (>2 mmol/L indicates anaerobic metabolism and inadequate tissue perfusion), and fever (38.9\u00b0C) are all critical indicators of septic shock and multi-organ dysfunction. The other options miss key elements or prioritize less critical findings. While tachypnea is present, the low blood pressure and hypoxemia are more direct indicators of circulatory and respiratory failure, respectively, in the context of sepsis.",

  {
    "questionText": "A 6-month-old infant is admitted with a severe respiratory infection. The nurse observes nasal flaring, intercostal retractions, and a respiratory rate of 60 breaths/min. The infant's temperature is 39.5\u00b0C (103.1\u00b0F). The parents report the infant has been irritable and feeding poorly for the past 12 hours. The nurse anticipates an order for a complete blood count (CBC) with differential. Which finding on the CBC with differential would be most indicative of a bacterial infection requiring immediate intervention, given the clinical picture?",

      "A": "Lymphocytosis of 55%",
      "B": "Neutrophilia of 80% with a 'left shift'",

      "D": "Monocytosis of 12%",
      "E": "Basophilia of 2%"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "rationale": "Neutrophilia (an increase in neutrophils, typically above 70%) with a 'left shift' (an increase in immature neutrophils, or bands) is a hallmark indicator of an acute bacterial infection. In a severely ill infant with respiratory distress and high fever, this finding would strongly support bacterial etiology and necessitate immediate antimicrobial therapy. Lymphocytosis is more common in viral infections. Eosinophilia suggests allergies or parasitic infections. Monocytosis is associated with chronic infections. Basophilia is typically seen in allergic reactions or chronic inflammation.",

The nurse suspects viral hepatitis. Given the client's history, which type of hepatitis is the most critical to screen for due to its high propensity for chronic infection and progression to cirrhosis and hepatic cancer, and for which no vaccine is currently available?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hepatitis A (HAV)",

      "D": "Hepatitis D (HDV)",
      "E": "Hepatitis E (HEV)"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "rationale": "Hepatitis C (HCV) is highly associated with intravenous drug use and has a high risk of progressing to chronic infection, cirrhosis, and hepatic cancer. Unlike HAV and HBV, there is no vaccine available for HCV, making screening and early treatment crucial. HBV also has a risk of chronicity and cancer but has a vaccine. HAV and HEV are typically acute, self-limiting, and transmitted via the fecal-oral route. HDV requires co-infection with HBV.",

Which five instructions are most critical for the nurse to include in the discharge teaching to prevent HBV transmission within the household?",

    "correctAnswer": "A,B,C,F",
    "rationale": "Hepatitis B is transmitted through blood and body fluids. Avoiding sharing personal items like razors, toothbrushes, and nail clippers (A) prevents indirect blood-to-blood contact. Vaccination of household members (B) provides active immunity. Consistent condom use (C) prevents sexual transmission. Disinfecting kitchen surfaces (D) and avoiding sharing food/utensils (E) are more relevant for fecal-oral transmitted infections like HAV or HEV, not HBV. Not donating blood, plasma, organs, or tissue (F) is crucial to prevent transmission via these routes.",

The client denies missing any ART doses. Which initial action by the nurse demonstrates the most astute clinical judgment?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Reinforce the importance of strict ART adherence and reschedule a follow-up in 2 weeks.",
      "B": "Assess for recent exposure to new infections or any new medications/supplements.",
      "C": "Educate the client on the need for increased condom use due to rising viral load.",
      "D": "Prepare the client for immediate initiation of a new, more potent ART regimen.",
      "E": "Order a genotypic resistance test to assess for drug-resistant mutations."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "E",
    "rationale": "A sudden increase in viral load despite reported adherence suggests potential drug resistance, which is a critical concern in HIV management. The most astute initial action is to order a genotypic resistance test (E) to identify specific mutations that might be causing the ART to be ineffective. While adherence reinforcement (A) is always important, the client denies missing doses, making resistance a higher suspicion. Assessing for new infections/meds (B) is a good secondary step but resistance testing directly addresses the most concerning possibility for a sudden viral load increase. Increased condom use (C) is a general prevention measure, not the immediate priority for this clinical change. Initiating a new regimen (D) without knowing the resistance profile could lead to further treatment failure.",
