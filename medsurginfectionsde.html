    "questionText": "A nurse is caring for a client admitted with a severe bacterial infection. The nurse observes the client's skin is flushed, and the client reports feeling warm. The nurse understands that which inflammatory mediator is primarily responsible for increasing blood flow and vascular permeability in the early acute inflammatory response?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Prostaglandins",
      "B": "Bradykinins",
      "C": "Histamine and Serotonin",
      "D": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α)"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "rationale": "Histamine and serotonin are released by mast cells and basophils early in the acute inflammatory response, directly causing vasodilation (increased blood flow, leading to redness and warmth) and increased vascular permeability (leading to swelling). Prostaglandins and leukotrienes are involved in later stages and also increase vascular leakiness, but histamine and serotonin are primary initial mediators. Bradykinins increase vascular leakiness and cause pain. TNF-α promotes cell growth, increases phagocytosis, and causes fever, but isn't the primary initial mediator for these specific vascular changes.",

    "type": "mc"
  },
  {
    "questionText": "A client presents to the clinic with a localized infection characterized by redness, swelling, and warmth. The nurse understands that which step in the acute inflammatory process directly contributes to the visible swelling?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Tissue injury and release of chemical signals",
      "B": "Blood vessel widening (vasodilation)",
      "C": "Increased vascular permeability allowing plasma leakage",
      "D": "White blood cell migration to the injured area"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "rationale": "Swelling (edema) in inflammation is primarily caused by increased vascular permeability, which allows water, salts, fibrinogen, and other small proteins from the plasma to leak into the surrounding tissue. While vasodilation increases blood flow, the actual fluid accumulation outside the vessels is due to the increased leakiness. Tissue injury initiates the process, and WBC migration is a cellular response, not the direct cause of the fluid swelling.",
    "section": "Inflammation: Acute Response",
    "type": "mc"
  },
  {
    "questionText": "A nurse is reviewing a client's lab results and notes an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level. The client has no obvious signs of acute infection or trauma. The nurse understands that an elevated CRP can indicate which type of inflammation?",

      "A": "Acute inflammation only",
      "B": "Localized inflammation only",
      "C": "Subclinical chronic inflammation",
      "D": "Only inflammation caused by physical harm"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "rationale": "C-reactive protein (CRP) is a non-specific marker of inflammation. An elevated CRP, especially without acute symptoms, is often indicative of subclinical chronic inflammation. It confirms the presence of inflammation but does not specify its location or cause, and it can be elevated in both acute and chronic processes, not just those from physical harm.",

      "C": "Practicing good hand hygiene consistently",
      "D": "Administering nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) daily"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "rationale": "Primary prevention aims to prevent inflammation from occurring by reducing the risk of injury and infection. Practicing good hand hygiene significantly lowers the risk of spreading germs and infections that can lead to inflammation. Regular CRP screening is secondary prevention. RICE therapy and NSAID administration are interventions for existing inflammation.",

    "questionText": "A nurse is assessing a newborn. The nurse understands that neonates are at higher risk for a more severe inflammatory response due to which physiological difference?",

      "C": "Reduced ability of immune cells to move to inflammation sites (chemotaxis)",
      "D": "Developed skin barrier with increased collagen"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "rationale": "Neonates often have weaker inflammatory responses to bacteria or viruses due to fewer granulocytes and monocytes, and a reduced ability of these cells to move to the site of inflammation (chemotaxis). They also have reduced complement responses. Their skin barrier is immature, offering less protection, making them more susceptible to severe responses.",

    "questionText": "A nurse is planning care for a client with Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS). The nurse recognizes that if the body's homeostasis is not restored, the client is at risk for progressing to which stage?",

      "C": "Body-wide reaction and organ dysfunction",
      "D": "Resolution and tissue repair"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "rationale": "SIRS progresses through three stages. Stage III, the most severe, involves a body-wide reaction and organ dysfunction if homeostasis is not restored. Increased cytokine production and localized swelling are characteristic of Stage I. Stimulation of growth factors and increased macrophages are part of Stage II. Resolution and tissue repair represent a positive outcome, not a progression of SIRS.",

    "questionText": "A client with a sprained ankle is advised to use Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation (RICE). The nurse explains that the primary goal of applying ice to the injured area is to achieve which effect?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Increase local blood flow to promote healing",
      "B": "Minimize swelling by causing vasoconstriction",
      "C": "Strengthen the joint ligaments immediately",
      "D": "Prevent bacterial infection at the injury site"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "rationale": "Applying ice causes vasoconstriction, which helps to minimize swelling by reducing blood flow and fluid leakage into the injured area. It does not increase blood flow, nor does it directly strengthen ligaments or prevent bacterial infection (though reducing swelling can indirectly support healing).",

    "questionText": "A client diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) asks the nurse to explain what is happening in their joints. The nurse describes the formation of a 'pannus.' Which statement accurately defines a pannus in the context of RA?",
    "options": {
      "A": "A collection of fluid within the joint space that lubricates the joint.",
      "B": "A fibrous adhesion that abnormally fuses bones in the joint.",
      "C": "Vascular granulation tissue composed of inflammatory cells that erodes cartilage and bone.",
      "D": "A protective layer of new cartilage that forms over damaged areas."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "rationale": "In rheumatoid arthritis, a pannus is defined as vascular granulation tissue composed of inflammatory cells that thickens the synovium and actively erodes articular cartilage and eventually destroys bone. It is not lubricating fluid, fibrous adhesions (which occur later as a result of the destruction), or a protective new cartilage layer.",

      "C": "Washing hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water",
      "D": "Consuming only bottled water to avoid contamination"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "rationale": "Frequent and thorough hand hygiene is the most effective primary prevention strategy against viral infections, as many are transmitted via respiratory droplets or contaminated surfaces. Antibiotics are for bacterial infections, strenuous exercise can sometimes suppress immunity, and while safe water is important, it's not the single most critical general prevention measure for all viral infections.",

    "rationale": "A UTI is an infection of the urinary tract, commonly involving inflammation of the bladder (cystitis). Cloudy or foul-smelling urine, along with the presence of leukocyte esterase (indicating WBCs) and nitrites (indicating bacteria), are classic signs of a UTI. The other options are inconsistent with a suspected UTI.",
