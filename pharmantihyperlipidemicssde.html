Statins can cause cataract formation, necessitating annual eye examinations. E. Grapefruit juice can increase the concentration of atorvastatin, potentially leading to increased side effects. B. While some positive effects may be seen in 3-5 days, it takes 2 to 4 weeks to achieve the full therapeutic effect of atorvastatin. D. Abruptly stopping statin drugs can cause a threefold rebound effect that may lead to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and possible death; therapy is typically a lifetime commitment.",

The anticoagulant dose should be reduced, and the INR should be closely monitored to prevent hemorrhage. A, B, C. Administering both without close monitoring or holding the medication without assessment of INR could lead to adverse outcomes. Increasing warfarin dosage would exacerbate the bleeding risk.",

Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) are common with niacin and can be decreased by taking the drug with meals. D. Large doses of niacin can cause vasodilation, leading to dizziness and faintness (hypotension/syncope). C. Hyperglycemia is a side effect of niacin, but it does not typically require immediate insulin administration; it is a long-term concern. E. Elevated serum liver enzymes can occur with niacin, but a slight transient increase may be within normal range and does not always necessitate immediate discontinuation; monitoring is required.",

Smoking increases LDL cholesterol and decreases HDL, making its elimination a priority. D. Saturated fats and cholesterol in the diet should be reduced, with total fat intake 30% or less of caloric intake and cholesterol intake 300 mg/day or less. A. Increasing total fat intake is contrary to the goal of cholesterol reduction. E.
