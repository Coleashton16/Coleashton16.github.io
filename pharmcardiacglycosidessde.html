The client's current medications include digoxin 0.125 mg daily, furosemide 40 mg daily, and potassium chloride 20 mEq daily. Upon assessment, the nurse notes the client's apical pulse is 52 beats/min and irregular. The client reports mild nausea and seeing 'yellow halos' around lights.\nWhich of the following actions must the nurse prioritize?",

The nurse's highest priority is to hold the digoxin to prevent further toxicity and notify the healthcare provider for immediate evaluation and potential intervention. Administering furosemide could worsen potential hypokalemia if it's contributing to toxicity, and while potassium chloride is important, addressing the immediate risk of digoxin toxicity takes precedence. Documentation is essential, but action is required first.",
