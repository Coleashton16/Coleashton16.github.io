        "options": {"A": "History of COPD", "B": "Atrial fibrillation", "C": "Concurrent use of a beta-blocker", "D": "Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)"},
        "correctAnswer": "D",
        "rationale": "This is a trick question forcing you to differentiate between cautions and contraindications. Ipratropium is an anticholinergic. Anticholinergics can cause urinary retention, which can acutely worsen BPH. While it's used in COPD (A), and its effects on the heart (B) are minimal compared to other bronchodilators, the risk of causing acute urinary obstruction makes BPH the most significant concern. The beta-blocker (C) is a concern with albuterol, not ipratropium.",

        "correctAnswer": "B",

        "rationale": "This is a trick question about therapeutic ranges. The therapeutic range for theophylline is 5-15 mcg/mL. Toxicity is LIKELY to occur >20 mcg/mL. A level of 18 is high-normal/borderline toxic, and the patient is showing early signs of toxicity (restlessness, nausea). The most prudent action is to hold the next dose to prevent the level from rising into the clearly toxic range and to document/report these findings.

        "rationale": "This is a SATA trick question testing understanding of combination inhalers. A is incorrect; this is a long-term controller, not a rescue inhaler. D is a tricky distractor; while salmeterol is a bronchodilator, its onset is not immediate like albuterol.
