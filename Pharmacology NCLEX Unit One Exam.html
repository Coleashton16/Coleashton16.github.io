    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q1">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Antidiarrheals like diphenoxylate/atropine (Lomotil) are contraindicated in suspected or confirmed Clostridium difficile infection because they can worsen the condition by retaining toxins and potentially precipitating toxic megacolon. Options B, C, and D are appropriate interventions for suspected C. difficile.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Administer diphenoxylate/atropine.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q2">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Promethazine is a vesicant and can cause severe chemical irritation and tissue damage if it extravasates. The symptoms described indicate potential extravasation or severe phlebitis. The infusion must be stopped immediately to prevent further harm. While other actions might be taken later, stopping the infusion is the priority.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Stop the infusion immediately.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q3">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Bulk-forming laxatives absorb water to increase bulk and promote peristalsis. Insufficient fluid intake can lead to esophageal or intestinal obstruction. Option B is incorrect; onset is typically 12-72 hours. Option C is general advice but not the most critical for this specific class. Mild cramping (D) can occur; severe cramping or obstruction symptoms would warrant discontinuation.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> "Take this medication with at least 8 ounces of fluid."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q4">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> The primary goal of lactulose in hepatic encephalopathy is to reduce ammonia levels, thereby improving mental status. While 2-3 soft stools are a means to excrete ammonia and a desired outcome for managing bowel movements, the ultimate therapeutic effect is neurological improvement. A decrease in ammonia is positive, but clinical improvement is the most direct indicator of therapeutic success. Decreased distension can occur but is not the primary indicator for encephalopathy treatment.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Improved level of consciousness and orientation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q5">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Aluminum-containing antacids are known to cause constipation. Magnesium-containing antacids tend to cause diarrhea. Hypermagnesemia is a risk with magnesium antacids, especially in renal impairment. Metabolic alkalosis can occur with excessive use of any antacid, but constipation is specific to aluminum-based ones.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Constipation</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q6">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Long-term use of Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) like omeprazole is associated with several potential complications: Increased risk of Clostridium difficile infection due to alteration of gut flora. Hypomagnesemia due to reduced intestinal absorption of magnesium. Vitamin B12 deficiency due to impaired absorption. Increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures due to potential effects on calcium absorption. Acute interstitial nephritis, though less common, is a serious renal adverse effect. All these are recognized long-term risks.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Texts:</strong> Increased risk of Clostridium difficile infection, Hypomagnesemia, Vitamin B12 deficiency, Increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures, Acute interstitial nephritis</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q7">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Sucralfate can bind to other medications in the GI tract and decrease their absorption. To prevent this interaction, sucralfate should be administered at least 2 hours apart from other medications like phenytoin. Taking them together would reduce phenytoin absorption. 30 minutes is often not enough separation. Crushing sucralfate is appropriate for administration if allowed, but mixing directly with phenytoin doesn't solve the absorption issue and the timing separation is key.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Administer sucralfate at least 2 hours apart from phenytoin.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q8">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> First-generation H1 antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine) are known for their sedative effects. This poses a significant safety risk, especially when performing tasks that require alertness. While dry mouth and appetite changes can occur, and administration with food can decrease GI upset, the risk of sedation and impaired motor skills is the priority safety concern.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> "Avoid operating heavy machinery or driving until you know how this drug affects you."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q9">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Anticholinergic drugs can cause mydriasis (pupil dilation), which can precipitate an acute angle-closure glaucoma attack in susceptible individuals. Therefore, narrow-angle glaucoma is a significant contraindication. Hypothyroidism, peptic ulcer disease, and hypertension are generally not contraindications for anticholinergic use, though side effects might need monitoring in some contexts.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Narrow-angle glaucoma</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q10">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> St. John's Wort is a potent inducer of CYP450 enzymes, particularly CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, which metabolize warfarin. This leads to increased warfarin metabolism and a decreased INR (reduced anticoagulant effect), increasing the risk of clotting. Therefore, the INR needs close monitoring, and the warfarin dose may need to be increased. Decreasing warfarin would be inappropriate. Spacing doses doesn't mitigate this metabolic interaction.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Monitor the INR more frequently and anticipate a potential need to increase the warfarin dose.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q11">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> The Z-track method is specifically designed to seal medication deep within the muscle tissue and prevent it from leaking back into the subcutaneous tissue or along the needle track. This minimizes irritation, pain, and potential staining for certain medications (e.g., iron dextran, promethazine IM). A 25-gauge, 5/8-inch needle is typically for subcutaneous or intradermal injections. A 45-degree angle is for subcutaneous injections. Vigorous massage is generally contraindicated after Z-track or for irritating medications as it can promote leakage and irritation.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Employing the Z-track injection method.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q12">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Chronic alcohol abuse leads to thiamine deficiency, which can cause Wernicke's encephalopathy (confusion, ataxia, nystagmus) and progress to Korsakoff syndrome (amnesia, confabulation). Parenteral thiamine is crucial for prevention and treatment. Vitamin B12 deficiency is associated with pernicious anemia and neurological symptoms, but thiamine is specific for Wernicke-Korsakoff. Vitamin K is for clotting factor synthesis. Vitamin D is for calcium absorption.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q13">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Sympathomimetic nasal decongestants like pseudoephedrine can cause vasoconstriction, leading to increased blood pressure (a concern for hypertensive patients), and can also worsen urinary retention in clients with BPH. Antihistamines can also contribute to urinary retention due to their anticholinergic effects, but sympathomimetic decongestants pose a dual threat in this client. Dextromethorphan is generally safe unless combined with MAOIs or SSRIs in high doses.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> The nasal decongestant (e.g., pseudoephedrine), due to risk of increased blood pressure and urinary retention.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q14">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> The first trimester is a critical period of organogenesis, making it the most vulnerable time for teratogenic effects. Any medication use requires careful risk-benefit analysis. Many antiemetics are not Category A; for example, ondansetron has had some concerns. Scopolamine is Category C and not first-line. OTC status does not guarantee safety in pregnancy (e.g., NSAIDs in the third trimester).</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> The benefits of treating severe nausea must outweigh the potential risks to the fetus, especially in the first trimester.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q15">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Gentamicin is nephrotoxic and ototoxic. The elevated BUN and creatinine indicate acute kidney injury (AKI). Hyperkalemia (K+ 5.8 mEq/L) is also a sign of renal dysfunction. Continuing gentamicin would worsen renal damage. Notifying the HCP is crucial for re-evaluation of therapy. While hyperkalemia needs addressing, stopping the offending agent is primary. Increased fluids may be helpful but not the priority over stopping the nephrotoxic drug. A potassium-sparing diuretic is contraindicated with hyperkalemia.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Hold the next dose of gentamicin and notify the healthcare provider.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q16">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> IV administration delivers the drug directly into the systemic circulation, bypassing absorption and the first-pass metabolism in the liver that oral medications undergo. This results in immediate and complete (100%) bioavailability. IV meds often have a higher risk of rapid-onset systemic side effects. PO is generally more convenient for long-term use. Drug interactions can occur regardless of route, though the nature might differ.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Avoidance of the first-pass effect, leading to 100% bioavailability.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q17">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Many elixirs and suspensions, especially those containing sorbitol, are hyperosmolar and can cause osmotic diarrhea when administered via PEG tube. Diluting these medications (if compatible and recommended by pharmacy/drug literature) can reduce their osmolarity and alleviate diarrhea. Requesting an antidiarrheal addresses the symptom but not the cause. Switching all meds to crushed tablets may not be feasible (e.g., enteric-coated, sustained-release) and doesn't directly address the osmolarity of remaining liquids. Stopping tube feeding is a significant step and might not be necessary if the cause is medication formulation.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Dilute the hyperosmolar liquid medications with sterile water before administration, if appropriate.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q18">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> For rapid volume expansion in hypovolemic shock, an isotonic crystalloid is preferred. Lactated Ringer's and 0.9% Sodium Chloride (Normal Saline) are both isotonic. LR is often favored as its electrolyte composition is closer to plasma and it helps buffer acidosis that can occur in shock. 0.45% NaCl is hypotonic and would not effectively expand intravascular volume. D5W is isotonic in the bag but becomes hypotonic once dextrose is metabolized. 3% NaCl is hypertonic and used for specific situations like severe hyponatremia or cerebral edema, not typically for initial hypovolemic shock resuscitation.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Lactated Ringer's (LR) solution</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q19">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Scopolamine is an anticholinergic drug. Blurred vision, dry mouth, and drowsiness are common and expected anticholinergic side effects. While these can be bothersome, they are not typically signs of an allergic reaction unless accompanied by rash, hives, or anaphylaxis. They don't necessarily indicate an overdose requiring immediate removal unless severe or accompanied by more serious symptoms like confusion, hallucinations, or urinary retention. Incorrect application usually leads to lack of effect rather than these specific systemic side effects.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Expected anticholinergic side effects.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q20">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Ondansetron is a serotonin (5-HT3) receptor antagonist. Common side effects include headache, constipation, and diarrhea. A more serious potential adverse effect is QT interval prolongation, which can increase the risk of torsades de pointes. EPS and tardive dyskinesia are associated with dopamine antagonist antiemetics (e.g., metoclopramide, prochlorperazine). Significant sedation and respiratory depression are more characteristic of phenothiazines (e.g., promethazine) or opioids.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Headache and QT interval prolongation</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q21">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Misoprostol is a prostaglandin analog that can cause uterine contractions and is an abortifacient (Pregnancy Category X). It is absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy unless used for cervical ripening/labor induction under medical supervision. Therefore, effective contraception is essential. While other instructions are relevant (GI upset, diarrhea is a common side effect, it protects the stomach lining and can decrease acid), the teratogenic risk is paramount.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> "You must use effective contraception during and for one month after misoprostol therapy."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q22">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> PRBCs are indicated to increase oxygen-carrying capacity in anemic clients. They provide red blood cells with a much smaller volume of plasma compared to whole blood, which is crucial for clients at risk of fluid overload or who do not need the extra plasma volume. Whole blood contains all components and a larger volume, typically reserved for massive hemorrhage. FFP is used to replace clotting factors. Platelets are for thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction. Given the active bleeding and severe anemia, PRBCs are the priority to improve oxygenation.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Packed red blood cells (PRBCs)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q23">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Promethazine can cause severe tissue injury (including gangrene) if extravasation occurs. After stopping the infusion (which is the first crucial step), the HCP must be notified immediately for further orders, which may include specific treatments to limit tissue damage (e.g., phentolamine, hyaluronidase, or specific compresses per policy – often cold for vesicants initially, though policies vary). Oral analgesics address pain but not tissue injury. Warm compresses may be contraindicated with some vesicants as they can increase drug spread; cold is often preferred initially, but specific orders are needed. Documentation is vital but not the priority over immediate medical consultation for intervention.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Notify the healthcare provider and prepare for potential administration of an antidote or further treatment for extravasation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q24">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Magnesium is excreted by the kidneys. In clients with chronic renal failure, magnesium-containing laxatives (like magnesium hydroxide or magnesium citrate) can lead to hypermagnesemia, which can cause serious adverse effects including hypotension, respiratory depression, and cardiac arrest. Psyllium requires adequate fluid intake, which might be an issue with fluid restriction, but doesn't pose the same systemic electrolyte risk. Docusate is generally safe. Bisacodyl acts locally and is less likely to cause systemic electrolyte issues related to renal failure, though dependency can be a concern with long-term use.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Magnesium hydroxide (osmotic - saline)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q25">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> The goal of lactulose in hepatic encephalopathy is to promote the excretion of ammonia through the stool. Typically, 2-3 soft stools per day indicate effective therapy. Asterixis (liver flap) is a key sign of hepatic encephalopathy, and its reduction, along with improved mental status, signals efficacy. Frequent watery diarrhea might indicate overdosage and can lead to dehydration/electrolyte imbalance. Lactulose can cause hypokalemia, not hyperkalemia. BUN is more related to renal function and hydration status, not a direct measure of lactulose efficacy for encephalopathy.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> The client has 2-3 soft, formed stools per day and reduced asterixis.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q26">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Aluminum-based antacids cause constipation. They also bind phosphate in the GI tract, which can lead to hypophosphatemia with prolonged high-dose use. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that causes potassium loss, not typically directly related to the antacid's phosphate binding or constipation effect. Diarrhea is associated with magnesium antacids. Metabolic alkalosis (not acidosis) can occur with excessive systemic absorption of some antacids, but constipation and hypophosphatemia are specific concerns with high-dose aluminum antacids.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Worsening constipation and potential hypophosphatemia.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q27">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Long-term PPI use is a known risk factor for hypomagnesemia. Symptoms of hypomagnesemia include neuromuscular excitability (tetany, muscle weakness, tremors, seizures) and cardiac manifestations such as ECG changes (prolonged QT interval, T-wave flattening or inversion) and arrhythmias like Torsades de Pointes. Hyperkalemia typically causes peaked T waves and widened QRS. Hyponatremia symptoms are primarily neurological. Hypercalcemia can cause muscle weakness but different ECG changes (shortened QT).</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Hypomagnesemia</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q28">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Sucralfate can significantly decrease the absorption of fluoroquinolones like ciprofloxacin by binding to them in the GI tract. To minimize this interaction, ciprofloxacin should be given at least 2 hours before or 4-6 hours after sucralfate. Taking them together or mixing would impair ciprofloxacin efficacy. While sucralfate is typically taken on an empty stomach (1 hour before meals and at bedtime) for ulcer treatment, the critical instruction here is the separation from ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin can be taken with or without food, but food (especially dairy or calcium-fortified) can also reduce its absorption, though the sucralfate interaction is more pronounced.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Administer ciprofloxacin at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after sucralfate.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q29">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> While H1 receptors are primarily responsible for acute allergic symptoms like itching and hives, H2 receptors are also found on endothelial cells and contribute to vasodilation and increased vascular permeability in systemic allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Combining H1 and H2 blockers can provide more complete blockade of histamine effects, particularly in managing severe urticaria and as adjunctive therapy in anaphylaxis (after epinephrine). Sedation is a side effect, not the goal. While H2 blockers reduce acid, this isn't the primary reason for combination in acute allergy. H2 blockers don't reduce H1 blocker anticholinergic effects.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> To target both H1 and H2 receptors involved in systemic allergic responses, especially urticaria and anaphylaxis.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q30">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Myasthenia gravis is characterized by a deficiency of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. Anticholinergic drugs block the action of acetylcholine. In a client with myasthenia gravis, who already has impaired neuromuscular transmission, further blocking acetylcholine can worsen muscle weakness and potentially trigger a myasthenic crisis (severe muscle weakness leading to respiratory failure). Pyridostigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used to treat myasthenia gravis by increasing acetylcholine; anticholinergics would counteract its effects, not potentiate them to cause cholinergic crisis. Anticholinergics generally don't cause severe hypertension; they primarily affect parasympathetic targets. They don't directly interfere with nutrient absorption in a way that is the primary concern here.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Exacerbate muscle weakness and precipitate a myasthenic crisis.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q31">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Ginkgo Biloba can inhibit platelet aggregation and may increase the risk of bleeding when taken with warfarin, potentially increasing the INR. Kale and spinach are rich in Vitamin K, which is an antagonist to warfarin and promotes clotting, thereby potentially decreasing the INR. This combination creates opposing effects on the INR, making anticoagulation difficult to manage and unpredictable.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Increased INR from Ginkgo and decreased INR from Vitamin K-rich foods, leading to unpredictable anticoagulation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q32">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> The Z-track method is used to prevent leakage of medication into the subcutaneous tissue after an IM injection. This is particularly important for medications that: Cause irritation or damage to subcutaneous tissue (e.g., promethazine, hydroxyzine) and Stain the skin (e.g., iron dextran). While viscosity influences needle choice, Z-track itself doesn't primarily address it. Rapid absorption is characteristic of IM injections in general, not specific to Z-track. Small volumes don't necessarily mandate Z-track; the nature of the medication is key.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Texts:</strong> Cause irritation or damage to subcutaneous tissue, Stain the skin.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q33">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> The symptoms described (tremors, agitation, tachycardia, diaphoresis) are classic signs of alcohol withdrawal. Withdrawal seizures are a known complication of severe alcohol withdrawal, typically occurring 12-48 hours after the last drink. Wernicke's encephalopathy presents with confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia. Hepatic encephalopathy involves altered mental status due to liver dysfunction and ammonia buildup. Thiamine deficiency can cause Wernicke's but isn't directly linked to hypertensive crisis and seizures in this acute withdrawal context.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome, specifically withdrawal seizures.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q34">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Many adult OTC cold medications are combination products. Some ingredients (e.g., certain decongestants, higher doses of antihistamines) may not be safe or appropriate for young children. Additionally, concentrations differ, making accurate dosing by "giving a smaller amount" risky and prone to error. Children's drug metabolism varies by age and drug; some drugs are metabolized slower, increasing toxicity risk. Simple weight adjustment isn't always sufficient due to differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Overdosing and toxicity (not just underdosing) are significant risks.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Adult formulations may contain multiple ingredients, some of which are contraindicated or dosed differently for children.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q35">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A platelet count of 75,000/mm³ is significantly low (thrombocytopenia) and, in a client receiving heparin, raises strong suspicion for Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT is a life-threatening immune complication of heparin therapy that paradoxically causes thrombosis. Heparin must be discontinued immediately if HIT is suspected. An aPTT of 70 seconds is within the therapeutic range for heparin therapy (typically 1.5-2.5 times control). Hemoglobin of 11.5 g/dL is slightly low for pregnancy but not acutely critical in this context. Potassium of 3.8 mEq/L is within normal limits.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Platelet count of 75,000/mm³.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q36">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Peaked T waves and widened QRS complexes are signs of severe hyperkalemia causing cardiac toxicity, which is a medical emergency. IV regular insulin administered with dextrose (D50W to prevent hypoglycemia) works rapidly to shift potassium from the extracellular fluid into the intracellular space, thus temporarily reducing the serum potassium level and stabilizing cardiac membranes. Kayexalate works slowly in the GI tract to remove potassium and is not for acute emergencies. Furosemide may not be effective in ESRD if the client is anuric or has minimal urine output and won't work quickly enough for cardiac toxicity. Sevelamer is a phosphate binder, not for acute hyperkalemia.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Regular insulin 10 units IV along with D50W.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q37">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> First-pass metabolism means that after oral administration, a significant portion of the drug is metabolized by the liver before it reaches systemic circulation. This reduces the drug's bioavailability. To achieve the same therapeutic concentration in the blood as an IV dose (which has 100% bioavailability as it bypasses the liver initially), a much higher oral dose is typically required to compensate for the drug lost during the first pass.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> The PO dose would be significantly higher than the IV dose.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q38">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Flushing the tube with water before and after each medication helps ensure the medication is cleared from the tube and prevents adherence and clogging. Warm water (not hot) can sometimes help dissolve medication residues better than cold water. Administering medications separately and flushing between each one prevents potential physical or chemical incompatibilities between drugs and ensures each dose is delivered fully. Enteric-coated and sustained-release tablets should generally NOT be crushed as it alters their absorption and release properties. Mixing medications can lead to incompatibilities and tube clogging.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Texts:</strong> Flushing the tube with at least 15-30 mL of water before and after each medication., Using warm water for flushing if not contraindicated., Administering each medication separately, flushing in between if multiple meds are given at the same time.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q39">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Hypertonic saline (like 3% NaCl) creates an osmotic gradient, drawing water from the interstitial and intracellular spaces (including edematous brain tissue) into the intravascular compartment. This reduces cerebral edema and helps lower ICP. It does not provide free water; in fact, it can cause cellular dehydration if not carefully monitored. While it does expand intravascular volume, its primary purpose in this context is to reduce ICP. It can correct hyponatremia, but its use for ICP management is independent of that, though hyponatremia can worsen cerebral edema.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Pull fluid from the brain tissue into the intravascular space, reducing cerebral edema.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q40">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Confusion, agitation, and urinary retention are signs of significant central and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity, which can be severe with scopolamine, especially in older adults or with prolonged use. Removing the patch (the source of the drug) is the first step. The HCP needs to be notified for further assessment and management, which might include supportive care or an antidote like physostigmine in severe cases. Administering a sedative could worsen confusion or respiratory depression. Forcing fluids won't resolve anticholinergic-induced urinary retention. These are not temporary side effects to ignore when they are this pronounced.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Remove the scopolamine patch and notify the healthcare provider.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q41">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Metoclopramide is a dopamine antagonist that can cause extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a serious, often irreversible EPS characterized by involuntary movements, especially of the face, lips, tongue, and extremities (e.g., lip smacking, frowning, blinking, chewing movements). It typically develops with long-term use. Acute dystonic reaction involves sudden muscle spasms. Akathisia is motor restlessness. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a rare but life-threatening reaction with fever, rigidity, autonomic dysfunction, and altered mental status.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Tardive dyskinesia.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q42">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Misoprostol is a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analog. NSAIDs cause gastric mucosal injury primarily by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. Prostaglandins play a crucial role in maintaining mucosal integrity by stimulating mucus and bicarbonate secretion and maintaining mucosal blood flow. Misoprostol replaces these protective prostaglandins, thus preventing NSAID-induced ulcers. PPIs inhibit the proton pump. Antacids neutralize acid. Sucralfate forms a protective coating.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Replacing protective prostaglandins that are diminished by NSAID therapy.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q43">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Flushing, chills, and fever are hallmark signs of a febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction, the most common type, but they can also herald more severe reactions like sepsis or an acute hemolytic reaction. The absolute priority is to stop the transfusion immediately to prevent further exposure to the blood product. The tubing should also be disconnected (while maintaining IV access with normal saline) to prevent any more blood from infusing. Then, the HCP is notified, and further supportive measures are taken. Continuing or slowing the transfusion is unsafe when a reaction is suspected.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Stop the transfusion immediately and disconnect the PRBC tubing from the IV catheter.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q44">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> PPIs (e.g., omeprazole) work by irreversibly inhibiting the H+/K+-ATPase enzyme system (the proton pump) in gastric parietal cells, which is the final common pathway for gastric acid secretion. This leads to a more profound and prolonged reduction in acid production compared to H2 receptor antagonists, which competitively block histamine at H2 receptors on parietal cells. PPIs don't neutralize acid; antacids do. They don't provide a protective coating; sucralfate does. H2 blockers and antacids often have a faster onset for immediate relief, but PPIs provide more potent and sustained acid suppression for healing.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Irreversibly block the final step of gastric acid secretion.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q45">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Magnesium is excreted by the kidneys. In clients with renal insufficiency, even mild, the ability to excrete magnesium is impaired, leading to a risk of accumulation and hypermagnesemia if magnesium-containing antacids are used. Symptoms of hypermagnesemia include hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory depression, diminished or absent deep tendon reflexes, and drowsiness. Constipation and phosphate depletion are associated with aluminum antacids. Metabolic alkalosis (not acidosis) can occur with excessive antacid use. C. difficile risk is more linked to PPIs or antibiotics.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Signs of hypermagnesemia such as hypotension and diminished deep tendon reflexes.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q46">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> An air embolism is a life-threatening emergency. Placing the client in Trendelenburg position on their left side (Durant's maneuver) helps trap the air in the right ventricle, preventing it from entering the pulmonary circulation. Administering high-flow oxygen helps treat hypoxia. Stopping the source of air entry by clamping the catheter is crucial. Immediate notification of the RRT/HCP is essential for advanced care. Attempting to aspirate air is a valid intervention but usually follows the immediate life-saving positioning and oxygenation, and clamping the line to prevent further air entry is a higher initial priority among catheter manipulations.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Texts:</strong> Immediately place the client in Trendelenburg position on their left side., Administer oxygen at a high flow rate., Stop the TPN infusion and clamp the central line catheter., Notify the Rapid Response Team and healthcare provider immediately.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q47">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine with sedative properties. While effective for occasional insomnia, tolerance to its sedative effects can develop quickly with regular use (typically within days to weeks), making it less effective. It is not recommended for chronic nightly use for insomnia. The other statements are correct: (A) addresses sedative effects, (C) addresses anticholinergic side effects, and (D) is important as anticholinergics are contraindicated in narrow-angle glaucoma.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> "I can take this medication every night if I have trouble sleeping."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q48">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Low serum albumin (hypoalbuminemia) reduces plasma oncotic pressure, contributing to fluid shifting from the intravascular space into the interstitial space, leading to edema and ascites in liver disease. Infusing concentrated albumin (like 25% albumin) helps to increase oncotic pressure, drawing fluid back into the intravascular compartment, which can temporarily reduce ascites and improve circulatory volume. Isotonic crystalloids or hypotonic/isotonic dextrose solutions would not correct the underlying oncotic pressure deficit and could potentially worsen fluid overload if not used judiciously with diuretics.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Albumin 25%</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q49">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Beta2-agonists (e.g., albuterol) generally have a faster onset of action and work to open the airways more quickly. Administering the beta2-agonist first can help to open the airways, allowing for better deposition and effectiveness of the subsequently administered anticholinergic bronchodilator (e.g., ipratropium), which often has a slower onset but longer duration. Waiting about 5 minutes between inhalers allows the first medication to take effect. Concurrent administration is generally not done with separate MDI inhalers. Sequence can matter for optimal effect.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Administer the beta2-agonist first, wait 5 minutes, then administer the anticholinergic.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q50">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Kava Kava has been associated with severe liver injury, including hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver failure. Jaundice (yellowing of the skin/eyes), dark urine, and elevated liver enzymes are classic signs of liver damage. Serotonin syndrome presents with autonomic hyperactivity, neuromuscular abnormalities, and mental status changes. Anxiety exacerbation would not directly cause these physical signs. While impurities can be a concern with herbals, Kava itself is linked to hepatotoxicity.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Hepatotoxicity related to Kava Kava use.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q51">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Ceftriaxone is a cephalosporin antibiotic. There is a potential for cross-sensitivity between penicillins and cephalosporins due to their similar beta-lactam ring structure. While the risk is relatively low (especially with later-generation cephalosporins if the penicillin allergy was not severe/anaphylactic), it's a critical consideration, and the prescriber should be aware or alternative chosen if allergy was severe. Vancomycin (a glycopeptide), ciprofloxacin (a fluoroquinolone), and clindamycin (a lincosamide) have different chemical structures and do not typically pose a cross-sensitivity risk with penicillin.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Ceftriaxone</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q52">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Chlordiazepoxide is a long-acting benzodiazepine commonly used in alcohol withdrawal protocols. It helps to control autonomic hyperactivity (tremors, tachycardia, hypertension), reduce anxiety and agitation, and most importantly, prevent more severe withdrawal complications such as seizures and delirium tremens (DTs) by substituting for alcohol's effects on GABA receptors. Thiamine is given for Wernicke's. Antipsychotics may be used for psychosis but benzodiazepines are primary for withdrawal. Naltrexone or acamprosate are used for cravings/abstinence maintenance, not acute detox.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Manage withdrawal symptoms and prevent seizures and delirium tremens.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q53">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Pseudoephedrine is a sympathomimetic agent that can increase blood pressure. MAOIs prevent the breakdown of catecholamines like norepinephrine. When pseudoephedrine is taken with an MAOI, there can be an excessive accumulation of norepinephrine, leading to a potentially life-threatening hypertensive crisis (markedly elevated blood pressure, severe headache, tachycardia, etc.). Sedation is not typical. Serotonin syndrome is more associated with SSRIs/SNRIs and other serotonergic drugs combined with MAOIs. Bradycardia is not expected; tachycardia is more likely.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Hypertensive crisis.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q54">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Intravenous (IV) administration delivers the drug directly into the bloodstream, providing immediate and 100% bioavailability. Sublingual (SL) administration involves placing the drug under the tongue, where it is absorbed through the oral mucosa directly into systemic circulation, bypassing the first-pass metabolism in the liver. This also leads to rapid onset. Oral meds undergo first-pass metabolism. Transdermal provides slow, sustained release. Intramuscular is faster than oral for many drugs but slower than IV and subject to local absorption factors.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Texts:</strong> Intravenous (IV), Sublingual (SL)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q55">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Current guidelines often suggest that for GRVs between 250-500 mL, the residual should be re-instilled (unless it appears abnormal), the feeding held temporarily (e.g., 1-2 hours), and then the GRV rechecked. The patient should also be assessed for other signs of intolerance (nausea, distension). Simply continuing with a high residual increases aspiration risk. Discarding large residuals can lead to fluid/electrolyte imbalances and nutrient loss. Stopping feeding and immediately requesting a prokinetic might be a later step if residuals remain high, but initial management involves holding and re-evaluating.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Re-instill the residual, hold the feeding for 1-2 hours, and then recheck GRV.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q56">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> D5 0.45% NaCl (D5 1/2 NS) is technically hypertonic in the bag due to the combined osmolarity of dextrose and sodium chloride. However, once infused, the dextrose is rapidly metabolized by cells, leaving behind a 0.45% NaCl solution, which is hypotonic. This hypotonic solution then provides free water that moves into cells, helping to treat intracellular dehydration, while the sodium helps maintain or expand extracellular fluid (ECF) volume to a lesser extent than isotonic solutions. It is not primarily for rapid volume expansion like 0.9% NS or LR. While it's hypertonic initially, its ultimate effect after dextrose metabolism is key. It does provide free water but its initial osmolarity is higher than just a hypotonic solution alone.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Isotonic in the bag but becomes hypotonic; provide calories and expand ECF.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q57">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Eradication of H. pylori typically requires combination therapy with at least two antibiotics to prevent the development of resistance and increase efficacy. The PPI is crucial as it suppresses acid production, which promotes ulcer healing and can also enhance the effectiveness of some antibiotics by raising gastric pH. Option A is too general. Option C misrepresents the roles (e.g., amoxicillin/clarithromycin are both antibiotics, neither primarily coats). H. pylori is transmissible but "highly contagious" is an overstatement, and not the reason for triple therapy's composition.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> "Using multiple antibiotics prevents bacterial resistance, and the PPI reduces acid to help the ulcer heal and antibiotics work better."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q58">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Urticaria and itching without other systemic signs (like hypotension, dyspnea, fever) often indicate a mild allergic (urticarial) transfusion reaction. For mild allergic reactions, the transfusion may be temporarily stopped or slowed, an antihistamine administered, and then, if symptoms resolve and there's no progression, the transfusion may be cautiously resumed per institutional policy and physician order. Immediately stopping and sending everything to lab is for more severe reactions. Epinephrine/intubation is for anaphylaxis. Discontinuing and starting a new unit isn't the first step for a mild, isolated urticarial reaction.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Slowing the transfusion rate and administering an IV antihistamine like diphenhydramine.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q59">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Promethazine is known to be very irritating to tissues and can cause severe damage if injected subcutaneously or if it leaks from the IM site. Deep IM injection into a large, well-developed muscle is essential. The ventrogluteal site is preferred over the dorsogluteal due to less risk of nerve/vascular injury. The Z-track method helps seal the medication within the muscle and prevent tracking back into subcutaneous tissue. Promethazine is not given subcutaneously. Rapid injection doesn't mitigate irritation risk, and dorsogluteal is less preferred. While dilution is sometimes used for IV promethazine (with extreme caution), for IM, proper site selection and Z-track are key for minimizing irritation of the concentrated IM form.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Deep IM injection into a large muscle mass, preferably the ventrogluteal site, using the Z-track method.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q60">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Lactulose is a non-absorbable disaccharide that is metabolized by colonic bacteria into acidic compounds (lactic acid, acetic acid). This acidification of the gut lumen promotes the conversion of diffusible ammonia (NH3) into the non-diffusible ammonium ion (NH4+). NH4+ is "trapped" in the colon and then excreted in the feces. Lactulose also has an osmotic laxative effect, which further aids in the expulsion of the trapped ammonium. It does not directly neutralize ammonia in blood, stimulate liver enzymes for ammonia metabolism, or primarily bind ammonia in portal circulation in that manner.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Conversion of ammonia (NH3) to ammonium ion (NH4+) in the gut, which is poorly absorbed, and promotion of its excretion.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q61">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Thiazide diuretics can cause hypokalemia. Hypokalemia potentiates the effects of digoxin and increases the risk of digoxin toxicity. Signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity include bradycardia (and other arrhythmias), visual disturbances (such as blurred vision, yellow or green halos around lights), nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and fatigue. Hyperkalemia is not caused by thiazides (they cause hypokalemia). Increased BP and fluid retention would indicate diuretic ineffectiveness. Hyperglycemia and thirst can be side effects of thiazides but are not direct signs of a digoxin-thiazide interaction leading to toxicity.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Bradycardia, visual disturbances (yellow halos), and nausea.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q62">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Common causes of nausea and cramping with tube feedings include formula that is too cold or administered too rapidly. These are easily correctable factors that should be assessed first. While auscultating bowel sounds and palpating is a good assessment, the rate/temp are more directly linked to acute intolerance during/after feeding. Administering an antiemetic treats the symptom, not the potential cause. Changing formula is a later consideration after ruling out simpler causes.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Check the temperature and rate of the feeding administration.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q63">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Sodium bicarbonate is an alkaline substance. Excessive ingestion can neutralize gastric acid and lead to systemic absorption of bicarbonate, increasing the body's alkali reserve and causing metabolic alkalosis. This is characterized by an elevated serum pH and elevated serum bicarbonate (HCO3-).</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Metabolic alkalosis</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q64">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Promethazine is a first-generation antihistamine with potent sedative effects due to its CNS depressant and anticholinergic properties. This drowsiness can significantly impair a person's ability to perform tasks requiring alertness, such as driving or operating machinery. While paradoxical excitation can occur, especially in children and the elderly, sedation is more common. Orthostatic hypotension can occur but is less universally limiting than sedation. Dry mouth is a common anticholinergic effect, but sedation often has a greater impact on daily activities.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Significant drowsiness or sedation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q65">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> The client is exhibiting signs of fluid volume overload (FVO). The immediate priority is to reduce the amount of fluid being infused. Slowing the infusion to a KVO rate (or stopping it if policy allows, then KVO with saline lock) is the first action to prevent worsening the FVO. Placing the client in high Fowler's will help with breathing and is done concurrently or immediately after. Notifying the HCP is essential, as is potentially administering a diuretic if ordered, but stopping or significantly reducing the fluid intake is the most direct and immediate intervention to address the cause.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Slow the IV infusion to a keep-vein-open (KVO) rate.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q66">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Long-term PPI use can lead to hypomagnesemia. Magnesium is crucial for normal cardiac function and neuromuscular activity. Deficiency can result in arrhythmias (e.g., Torsades de Pointes, ventricular tachycardia), prolonged QT interval, and neuromuscular symptoms like muscle weakness, tremors, tetany, and seizures. While other electrolytes are important, magnesium is specifically linked to these severe complications with chronic PPI use.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Serum magnesium</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q67">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Thiamine (Vitamin B1) is a critical cofactor for carbohydrate metabolism, including glucose. In a thiamine-deficient individual (common in alcohol abuse), administering glucose without first providing thiamine can rapidly deplete the already low thiamine stores as the body tries to metabolize the glucose. This acute depletion can precipitate or worsen Wernicke's encephalopathy, a serious neurological condition. Therefore, thiamine should always be given before or concurrently with glucose in at-risk patients.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Wernicke's encephalopathy.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q68">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Sucralfate works by forming a protective coating over the ulcer site. It requires an acidic environment to be activated and to bind effectively. Taking it on an empty stomach (typically 1 hour before meals and at bedtime) ensures it doesn't bind with food and has optimal contact with the ulcer. Taking it with meals or with antacids can reduce its effectiveness as antacids raise gastric pH and food can interfere with its coating action. While some forms may be crushable or available as a suspension, the key principle for efficacy is timing relative to food and other medications like antacids.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> "I need to take this medication on an empty stomach, about 1 hour before meals and at bedtime."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q69">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> In cases of infectious diarrhea, especially Clostridium difficile, anti-motility agents (like opioid-based antidiarrheals such as loperamide or diphenoxylate/atropine) are generally contraindicated. These medications slow intestinal peristalsis, which can prolong the retention of toxins produced by C. difficile in the gut, potentially worsening the infection and increasing the risk of complications like toxic megacolon. PPIs are a risk factor for C. diff but not acutely avoided during treatment unless specified. Antiemetics might be needed for nausea. Stool softeners are not typically used for acute diarrhea.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> Opioid-based antidiarrheals</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_q70">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> In cirrhosis with ascites, secondary hyperaldosteronism is common, leading to sodium and water retention and potassium excretion. Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist and a potassium-sparing diuretic. It is used to manage ascites by promoting sodium and water excretion while preventing hypokalemia, which is a risk with other diuretics. The hyponatremia in cirrhosis is often dilutional due to fluid retention, not true sodium deficit. Spironolactone doesn't aggressively correct hyponatremia; in fact, it can sometimes worsen it. It doesn't primarily target BUN. While it causes diuresis, its main benefit here is aldosterone antagonism and potassium sparing.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer Text:</strong> To manage ascites by promoting diuresis while conserving potassium, as hyperaldosteronism is common in cirrhosis.</p>
    </div>

        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong>
        1.  Calculate the concentration of heparin: 25,000 units / 500 mL = 50 units/mL.
        2.  Calculate the flow rate in mL/hr: (Ordered units/hr) / (Concentration units/mL) = mL/hr.
            1,000 units/hr / 50 units/mL = 20 mL/hr.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> 20</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_dc2">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong>
        1.  Convert weight to kg: 44 lbs / 2.2 lbs/kg = 20 kg.
        2.  Calculate total daily dose: 30 mg/kg/day * 20 kg = 600 mg/day.
        3.  Calculate dose per administration: 600 mg/day / 3 doses = 200 mg/dose.
        4.  Calculate volume to administer: (Desired dose / Have dose) * Volume per Have.
            (200 mg / 125 mg) * 5 mL = 1.6 * 5 mL = 8 mL.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> 8</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_dc3">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong>
        1.  Convert L to mL: 1 L = 1000 mL.
        2.  Convert hours to minutes: 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.
        3.  Calculate mL/min: 1000 mL / 480 minutes = 2.0833 mL/min.
        4.  Calculate gtt/min: (mL/min * drop factor) = gtt/min.
            2.0833 mL/min * 15 gtt/mL = 31.2495 gtt/min.
        5.  Round to the nearest whole number: 31 gtt/min.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> 31</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_dc4">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong>
        1.  Use the formula: (Desired dose / Have dose) * Volume per Have.
            (12.5 mg / 25 mg) * 1 mL = 0.5 mL.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> 0.5</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rationale-text-hidden" id="r_dc5">
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong>
        1. Use the formula: (Desired dose / Dose on hand) * Quantity on hand.
        (4 mg / 10 mg) * 1 mL = 0.4 mL.
        </p>
