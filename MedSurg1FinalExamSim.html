D5W is isotonic in the bag but becomes hypotonic in the body as dextrose is metabolized, potentially shifting fluid into cells and worsening cerebral edema if present, but primarily it adds free water.

Re-evaluating based *solely* on the text: HAV is explicitly mentioned for chronic liver disease. HBV's list doesn't explicitly include it. Therefore, the most accurate answer *solely* from the text for *this specific question* is A. However, the question asks 'which hepatitis vaccine is specifically recommended'.
