                        correctAnswer: "Continue",
                        explanation: `<strong>1. Process of Peptic Ulcer Development and Prevention:</strong><br>
                            Aspirin is a non-selective NSAID that inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. COX-1 is responsible for producing prostaglandins that protect the stomach lining by promoting mucus and bicarbonate secretion and maintaining mucosal blood flow. By inhibiting COX-1, aspirin reduces these protective mechanisms, making the stomach lining vulnerable to acid erosion, leading to gastritis and eventually peptic ulcers. This risk is dose-dependent and increases with prolonged use, especially in older adults.<br>
                            Prevention could have included: using enteric-coated aspirin, taking aspirin with food/milk, using a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or H2 blocker concurrently, considering a lower dose, or switching to a selective COX-2 inhibitor if appropriate for her overall health profile (considering cardiovascular risk).<br><br>
                            <strong>2. Similarities and Differences in Side Effects:</strong><br>
                            - <strong>Salicylates (Aspirin):</strong> High risk of GI distress (dyspepsia, nausea, abdominal pain, GI bleeding/ulceration), tinnitus, hearing loss, Reye syndrome (in children with viral infections), metabolic acidosis.<br>
                            - <strong>Propionic Acid Derivatives (e.g., Ibuprofen):</strong> Generally less GI irritation than aspirin, but still a common side effect. Can cause dyspepsia, nausea, abdominal pain, fluid retention, dizziness, headache. Risk of GI bleeding/ulceration is present but generally lower than aspirin at equivalent anti-inflammatory doses. Highly protein-bound, increasing drug interaction risk.<br>
                            - <strong>COX-2 Inhibitors (e.g., Celecoxib):</strong> Significantly lower risk of GI side effects (peptic ulcer, bleeding) because they spare COX-1. Common side effects include headache, dizziness, abdominal pain, nausea, peripheral edema. Higher cardiovascular risk (thromboembolism) is a concern.<br>
                            - <strong>General NSAID Similarities:</strong> All first-generation NSAIDs (including salicylates, propionic acids, para-chlorobenzoic acids, fenamates, oxicams) inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2 to varying degrees, leading to potential GI irritation, fluid retention, and effects on platelet aggregation. All can cause dizziness, headache, and dyspepsia. Renal impairment is a risk across most NSAIDs.<br><br>
                            <strong>3. Patient Teaching Points for Aspirin:</strong><br>
                            - Take with food, milk, or plenty of fluids to minimize GI distress. Enteric-coated tablets should not be crushed.<br>
                            - Avoid alcohol due to increased risk of GI irritation and bleeding.<br>
                            - Inform dentist/surgeon about aspirin use before any procedures (discontinue 7 days prior to surgery, if approved by provider, to reduce bleeding risk).<br>
                            - Report signs of bleeding (dark, tarry stools; bleeding gums; excessive bruising; petechiae).<br>
                            - Report side effects like tinnitus (ringing in ears), hearing loss, severe stomach pain, or unusual bruising.<br>
                            - Keep out of reach of children; never give to children with flu-like symptoms (Reye syndrome).<br>
                            - Acetaminophen is preferred for dysmenorrhea.<br><br>
                            <strong>4. How COX-2 Inhibitors Prevent Peptic Ulcers:</strong><br>
                            COX-2 inhibitors selectively block only the COX-2 enzyme, which is primarily responsible for mediating pain and inflammation. They do not significantly inhibit the COX-1 enzyme. COX-1 produces prostaglandins that are crucial for maintaining the integrity of the gastric mucosa by promoting mucus and bicarbonate production and regulating blood flow to the stomach lining. By preserving COX-1 activity, COX-2 inhibitors allow these protective mechanisms to remain intact, thereby significantly reducing the risk of peptic ulcers and GI bleeding compared to non-selective NSAIDs like aspirin.`
