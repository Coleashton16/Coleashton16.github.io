    // Question 1 (Trick Question)
    {
        "questionText": "A patient with a history of narrow-angle glaucoma, BPH, and a recent DVT is now taking warfarin. He reports cold symptoms and asks for advice. Which statement by the nurse is the highest priority?",
        "options": {
            "A": "You should avoid taking first-generation antihistamines like diphenhydramine due to your glaucoma and BPH.",
            "B": "It's important to avoid systemic decongestants like pseudoephedrine as they can increase blood pressure.",
            "C": "Make sure to not take any products containing aspirin or NSAIDs while you are on warfarin.",
            "D": "You should only take second-generation antihistamines like loratadine as they are safest."
        },
        "correctAnswer": "C",
        "rationale": "This is a priority question with multiple 'correct' teaching points. A and B are true statements regarding his co-morbidities. However, the most immediate life-threatening risk is bleeding from the combination of warfarin and NSAIDs/aspirin. Preventing a major hemorrhage is a higher priority than managing the potential side effects of antihistamines or decongestants. This question tricks you into focusing on the respiratory drugs when a more critical drug interaction is present.",
        "section": "Drug Interactions"
    },
    // Question 2 (Trick Question)
    {
        "questionText": "A patient has been using an oxymetazoline nasal spray four times a day for a week. They present with severe nasal congestion, a headache, and a blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg. What is the nurse's priority action?",
        "options": {
            "A": "Instruct the patient to stop the spray to manage rebound congestion.",
            "B": "Assess for signs of a secondary sinus infection.",
            "C": "Notify the provider of the patient's hypertensive state.",
            "D": "Recommend a saline nasal spray as a safer alternative."
        },
        "correctAnswer": "C",
        "rationale": "This question tests prioritization of an actual vs. potential problem. While rebound congestion is occurring (A) and saline is a good recommendation (D), the elevated blood pressure indicates a current and dangerous systemic adverse effect. The nurse's priority action is to report this critical finding to the provider. Systemic vasoconstriction can lead to stroke or cardiac events and is a more immediate threat than local discomfort.",
        "section": "Nasal Decongestants"
    },
    // Question 3
    {
        "questionText": "A patient taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) for depression requires a decongestant. Which of the following would be contraindicated?",
        "options": {"A": "Guaifenesin", "B": "Cetirizine", "C": "Pseudoephedrine", "D": "Budesonide nasal spray"},
        "correctAnswer": "C",
        "rationale": "Systemic decongestants like pseudoephedrine are sympathomimetic amines. When taken with an MAOI, they can cause a hypertensive crisis due to the additive adrenergic effects. This is a life-threatening interaction.",
        "section": "Drug Interactions"
    },
    // Question 4
    {
        "questionText": "What is the primary mechanism of action for intranasal glucocorticoids in the management of allergic rhinitis?",
        "options": {"A": "They stimulate alpha-adrenergic receptors, causing immediate vasoconstriction.", "B": "They exert a local anti-inflammatory effect, reducing all major symptoms over time.", "C": "They block H1 receptors, preventing histamine-mediated symptoms.", "D": "They act on the medullary cough center to suppress the sneeze reflex."},
        "correctAnswer": "B",
        "rationale": "Intranasal glucocorticoids (e.g., fluticasone, budesonide) are effective for allergic rhinitis because of their potent anti-inflammatory action. They decrease the synthesis and release of inflammatory mediators, thereby reducing all major symptoms like rhinorrhea, sneezing, and congestion.",
        "section": "Intranasal Glucocorticoids"
    },
    // Question 5 (Trick Question)
    {
        "questionText": "A parent asks the nurse why their child's pediatrician recommended loratadine over diphenhydramine. Which statement reflects the MOST accurate and comprehensive understanding?",
        "options": {
            "A": "Loratadine has a much faster onset of action for acute allergic reactions.",
            "B": "Diphenhydramine is not effective for treating allergic rhinitis in children.",
            "C": "Loratadine is preferred because it has minimal CNS effects and a lower risk of paradoxical excitement in children.",
            "D": "Loratadine is the only antihistamine that also treats nasal congestion."
        },
        "correctAnswer": "C",
        "rationale": "This question is tricky because other options have elements of truth, but C is the most complete answer. The primary advantage is fewer CNS effects (sedation). Additionally, the text notes that children are more susceptible to paradoxical excitement (nightmares, irritability) with first-generation antihistamines, making C the most comprehensive reason for the recommendation. D is incorrect. A is incorrect; diphenhydramine often works faster.",
        "section": "Antihistamines"
    },
    // Question 6
    {
        "questionText": "A patient presents with a dry, hacking, nonproductive cough that is interfering with sleep. Which medication would be most appropriate to recommend?",
        "options": {"A": "Guaifenesin", "B": "Dextromethorphan", "C": "Oxymetazoline", "D": "Cetirizine"},
        "correctAnswer": "B",
        "rationale": "Antitussives, such as dextromethorphan, are used to suppress a nonproductive cough. They act on the cough control center in the medulla. Guaifenesin is an expectorant, used to make a productive cough more effective, and would not be the first choice for a dry, irritating cough.",
        "section": "Antitussives"
    },
    // Question 7
    {
        "questionText": "The nurse is teaching a patient about using fluticasone nasal spray. Which instruction is essential to include to prevent a common local side effect?",
        "options": {"A": "Inhale forcefully as you administer the spray to ensure deep penetration.", "B": "Aim the spray away from the nasal septum.", "C": "Use the spray only when symptoms are severe to prevent dependence.", "D": "Warm the spray bottle in your hands for 5 minutes before each use."},
        "correctAnswer": "B",
        "rationale": "Directing the spray away from the nasal septum helps prevent local irritation, drying, and potential epistaxis (nosebleeds), which are common side effects of intranasal glucocorticoids.",
        "section": "Intranasal Glucocorticoids"
