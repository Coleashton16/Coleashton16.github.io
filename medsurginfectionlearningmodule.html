                            <p>Microorganisms are found throughout the environment. As a consequence, humans are constantly exposed to a multitude of microorganisms at every moment. Although many microorganisms do not pose a health threat to humans, some cause human disease and are known as pathogens. Our bodies are constantly confronted with pathogens in the forms of bacteria, viruses, parasites, or fungi. These pathogens are routinely found on the skin; the mucous membranes; the linings of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urinary tracts; and the mouth and eyes. Typically, an individual’s immune system is able to rid the body of pathogens without developing an infection. An infection occurs when a susceptible host is invaded by a pathogen that multiplies and causes disease. This concept presentation provides an overview of the infection concept, including identifying individuals most at risk, recognizing signs and symptoms of infection, and understanding ways to treat or manage an infection.</p>

                            <p>For the purposes of this concept presentation, infection is defined as the invasion and multiplication of microorganisms in body tissues, which may be clinically unapparent or result in local cellular injury due to competitive metabolism, toxins, intracellular replication, or antigen–antibody response. Several additional terms are important to understand.</p>

                            <p>Infections may be categorized in several ways, including on the basis of the multiple variables involved such as mode of transmission, trajectory of illness, and body systems affected. The most common way to categorize and discuss infections is based on the classification of the causative microorganism.</p>

                                <strong class="block text-gray-700">FIG. 23.1 Scope of Concept: Infection.</strong>
                                <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">This figure illustrates the scope of infection, categorized by the causative microorganism: Bacterial, Viral, Fungal, and Parasitic/Protozoan.</p>
                            </div>
                            <p>The most common microorganisms initiating an infection are bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites or protozoa. The type of invading organism influences the immune response. B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes take “leadership” roles depending on whether it is a bacterial or viral invasion. The complement system is always present to enhance the immune response, and dendritic cells help modulate the immune response.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Bacterial Infections</h4>
                            <p>Bacteria are one-celled organisms without a true nucleus or cellular organelles. They synthesize DNA, RNA, and proteins and can reproduce independently, but they require a host as a suitable environment for multiplication. Bacteria cause cellular injury by releasing exotoxins (enzymes released by gram-positive bacteria) or endotoxins (part of the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria).</p>

                            <h4>Viral Infections</h4>
                            <p>A virus is a pathogen with a nucleic acid within a protein shell and requires a host for replication. An invading virus may immediately cause disease or may remain dormant for years. The virus causes cellular injury by blocking the host cell’s protein synthesis and using the host cell’s metabolic processes for its own reproduction.</p>

                            <h4>Fungal Infections</h4>
                            <p>A fungus includes yeasts, molds, and mushrooms. In healthy individuals, fungi are often contained by natural flora. Fungi causing disease are termed fungi imperfecti and can be deadly in immunocompromised individuals. Other fungal infections, like athlete's foot, can develop in healthy individuals.</p>

                            <h4>Protozoa/Parasitic Infections</h4>
                            <p>Protozoa generally infect individuals with compromised immune responses. They are found in dead material in water and soil and are spread by the fecal-oral route. Disease can develop when spores invade organs and stimulate an immune response.</p>

                            <h4>Other Types of Infections</h4>
                            <p>Sometimes an infection will begin as one type and a secondary infection occurs. For example, a fungal infection may develop after antibiotic treatment for a bacterial infection. There is also a concern about emerging and reemerging infections, such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE).</p>

                            <p>Pathogens may be highly virulent (causing disease with small numbers) or weakly virulent (requiring a large number or a weakened host). Opportunistic infections cause disease when the host immune system is severely compromised.</p>
                            <p>Some diseases are communicable before symptoms are evident, while others remain communicable after symptoms subside. The "iceberg" concept of infectious disease suggests three levels: (1) a large asymptomatic carrier population, (2) a smaller group with less severe symptoms, and (3) the smallest group with classical clinical symptoms.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Infection Process</h4>
                            <p>The process of infection requires six elements: a pathogen, a susceptible host, a reservoir, a portal of exit, a mode of transmission, and a portal of entry.</p>

                            <h4>Pathogen Invasion</h4>
                            <p>When a pathogen invades, the immune system responds. B lymphocytes produce antibodies, T lymphocytes directly kill invaders, and macrophages initiate phagocytosis. The complement system enhances this response. Tissue damage can occur from endotoxins or exotoxins released by the pathogen, leading to symptoms like fever, chills, and weakness, or more severe outcomes like shock.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Age-Related Differences</h4>
                            <p>Infants and young children have immature immune systems, increasing their susceptibility. Older adults may have a diminished immune response, leading to muted symptoms like the absence of fever. Instead, they might present with confusion, dizziness, or fatigue. Comorbidities also alter the body's response to infection.</p>

                            <p>An inflammatory response increases vascular permeability, leading to hypovolemia and hypotension. The nervous system compensates with vasoconstriction. The renal system attempts to maintain filtration but eventually, continued hypoperfusion leads to decreased urine output.</p>
                            <h4>Respiratory Compensation</h4>
                            <p>The respiratory system compensates for hypoxemia by increasing the rate of respiration. This can be hampered by cardiovascular decompensation, leading to pulmonary edema, hypoxia, and hypercapnia.</p>
                            <h4>Multisystem Failure</h4>
                            <p>Without effective treatment, the combination of inadequate tissue perfusion, overextended compensatory mechanisms, and cell damage results in irreversible organ failure and death.</p>

                                <li><strong>Stage II: Chronic HIV Infection:</strong> Can be treated as a chronic disorder with drug therapy. Patients can have undetectable viral loads and live for decades.</li>
                                <li><strong>Stage III: Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS):</strong> Characterized by profoundly reduced immunity. Diagnosed when CD4+ T-cell count is <200 cells/mm³ or when specific opportunistic infections (OIs) are present.</li>

                            <p>HIV is a retrovirus, meaning it uses RNA as its genetic material. It uses the enzyme reverse transcriptase to convert its RNA into DNA, which is then integrated into the host cell's DNA. This allows the virus to take over the cell's machinery to produce more viral particles.</p>

                                <li><strong>Binding:</strong> HIV attaches to CD4 cell receptors.</li>
                                <li><strong>Fusion:</strong> HIV enters the CD4 cell.</li>
                                <li><strong>Reverse Transcription:</strong> HIV RNA is converted to HIV DNA.</li>
                                <li><strong>Integration:</strong> HIV DNA is inserted into the host cell's DNA.</li>
                                <li><strong>Replication:</strong> The host cell makes long chains of HIV proteins.</li>
                                <li><strong>Assembly:</strong> New, immature HIV particles are assembled.</li>
                                <li><strong>Budding:</strong> Immature HIV pushes out of the cell and matures into an infectious virus.</li>

                            <p>HIV is found in all body fluids but is transmitted most often through sexual contact, parenteral exposure (sharing needles), and perinatally (mother to child). It is NOT transmitted by casual contact.</p>
                            <h4>Sexual Transmission</h4>
                            <p>Safer sex practices are crucial. This includes consistent use of condoms for all types of intercourse and using water-based lubricants.</p>
                            <h4>Parenteral Transmission</h4>
                            <p>Preventive practices include using syringe services programs (SSPs) to obtain sterile needles and teaching proper cleaning techniques for those who reuse needles.</p>
                            <h4>Prophylactic Prevention</h4>
                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                                <li><strong>Preexposure Prophylaxis (PrEP):</strong> Antiretroviral drugs taken by an HIV-negative person at high risk to prevent infection. Reduces risk from sex by about 99%.</li>
                                <li><strong>Postexposure Prophylaxis (PEP):</strong> Antiretroviral treatment used in emergencies after a potential exposure. Must be started within 72 hours.</li>
                                <li><strong>Treatment as Prevention (TasP):</strong> An HIV-positive person takes medication to achieve an undetectable viral load, which greatly reduces the risk of sexual transmission.</li>

                            <p>A thorough and confidential history is essential. Ask about risk factors, sexual practices (using the "5 Ps": Partners, Practices, Protection, Past history, Prevention of pregnancy), and any current symptoms.</p>
                            <h4>Physical Assessment</h4>
                            <p>Assess for opportunistic infections (see Table 17.3 in original text), such as oral candidiasis, skin lesions (Kaposi sarcoma), and respiratory issues (PCP, TB). Monitor for neurologic changes, GI issues (diarrhea, weight loss), and other systemic symptoms.</p>
                            <h4>Laboratory Assessment</h4>

                                <li><strong>Serologic/Virologic Testing:</strong> Rapid tests, antigen/antibody combo assays, and home kits are available. A 3-week "seroconversion window" can produce false negatives.</li>
                                <li><strong>Lymphocyte Counts:</strong> Patients often have leukopenia (WBC < 4000) and lymphopenia.</li>
                                <li><strong>CD4+ T-cell Count:</strong> A key indicator of immune function. Normal is 600-1500 cells/mm³. A count <200 indicates Stage III (AIDS).</li>

                            <h4>Preventing Infections & Complications</h4>
                            <p>Management focuses on supporting immunity with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and preventing/treating opportunistic infections.</p>
                            <p><strong>Drug Therapy (cART):</strong> Uses multiple drugs from different classes (NRTIs, NNRTIs, Protease Inhibitors, etc.) to suppress viral replication. Adherence is critical to prevent drug resistance.</p>

                            <p><strong>Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS):</strong> An inflammatory reaction that can occur after starting cART as the immune system begins to recover and recognizes underlying opportunistic infections. It is usually treated with short-term corticosteroids.</p>
                            <p><strong>Management of Complications:</strong> Interventions are tailored to the specific opportunistic infection or complication, such as facilitating gas exchange for PCP, managing pain from neuropathy, enhancing nutrition to combat wasting syndrome, and preserving skin integrity from lesions like Kaposi sarcoma.</p>
