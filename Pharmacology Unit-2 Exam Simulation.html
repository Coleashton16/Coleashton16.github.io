    "questionText": "A 58-year-old patient with a history of heart failure and Type 2 Diabetes is prescribed a new medication regimen. The nurse notes an order for canagliflozin. Considering the patient's comorbidities, which assessment finding requires immediate follow-up by the nurse, indicating a potential adverse effect or complication of this medication, especially in a patient with heart failure?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Blood pressure reading of 130/80 mmHg.",
      "B": "A 1-kg weight gain over 24 hours.",
      "C": "Reports of increased thirst and frequency of urination.",
      "D": "Fasting blood glucose of 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L)."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "rationale": "Canagliflozin is an SGLT2 inhibitor, which works by increasing glucose excretion in the urine. This mechanism can lead to osmotic diuresis, causing increased thirst (polydipsia) and frequent urination (polyuria). While weight gain (B) could indicate worsening heart failure, increased thirst and urination are direct and common side effects of SGLT2 inhibitors and warrant immediate assessment to differentiate from uncontrolled diabetes or fluid volume deficit. Blood pressure (A) and blood glucose (D) are within acceptable ranges for many patients and not indicative of an immediate adverse effect of the medication itself that requires immediate intervention.",

  {
    "questionText": "A patient with a documented penicillin allergy is diagnosed with a severe soft tissue infection requiring antibiotic therapy. The healthcare provider orders azithromycin. The nurse understands that this prescription is based on which pharmacological principle?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Azithromycin is a beta-lactam antibiotic with minimal cross-reactivity with penicillin.",
      "B": "Azithromycin works by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis, similar to penicillin.",
      "C": "Azithromycin belongs to the macrolide class of antibiotics, which has a distinct mechanism of action from penicillins.",
      "D": "Azithromycin is typically reserved for penicillin-resistant infections due to its broad spectrum."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "rationale": "Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic. Macrolides inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit. This mechanism of action is entirely different from penicillins, which inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis. Therefore, macrolides generally do not have cross-reactivity with penicillin allergies, making them a safe alternative for patients with penicillin allergies. Options A and B are incorrect as azithromycin is not a beta-lactam and has a different mechanism. Option D is irrelevant to the safety profile for a penicillin-allergic patient.",

    "questionText": "A 72-year-old male patient presents to the emergency department with altered mental status, severe dehydration, and a blood glucose level of 850 mg/dL (47.2 mmol/L) without significant ketosis. The patient's wife reports a recent increase in thirst and urination, and he has a history of Type 2 Diabetes managed with oral medications. The healthcare provider suspects Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS). Which immediate nursing intervention is the most critical priority for this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Administer regular insulin via subcutaneous injection.",
      "B": "Initiate continuous intravenous infusion of 0.9% NaCl solution.",
      "C": "Administer IV push dextrose 50% to prevent hypoglycemia.",
      "D": "Prepare for immediate administration of IV potassium chloride."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "rationale": "In HHS, severe dehydration and hyperosmolarity are the primary life-threatening issues. The most critical immediate intervention is aggressive fluid resuscitation with isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) to correct dehydration and improve renal perfusion, thereby lowering blood glucose and improving hyperosmolarity. While insulin (A) is needed eventually, fluid replacement is the absolute priority to stabilize the patient. Dextrose (C) would worsen hyperglycemia. Potassium (D) is typically not the initial priority unless severe hypokalemia is already present, as potassium levels may initially be normal or high due to shifting out of cells in hyperglycemia.",

  {
    "questionText": "A patient is prescribed a new medication, omeprazole, for management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The nurse provides discharge teaching regarding the optimal administration of this medication. Which statement by the patient indicates a need for further instruction?",
    "options": {
      "A": "“I should take this medication about 30 to 60 minutes before my first meal of the day.”",
      "B": "“I can crush this pill and mix it with applesauce if I have trouble swallowing.”",
      "C": "“This medication helps reduce the acid production in my stomach.”",
      "D": "“I will try to avoid trigger foods like spicy meals and caffeine while taking this.”"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "rationale": "Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Many PPI formulations, especially delayed-release capsules or enteric-coated tablets, are designed to release the medication in the intestines to protect it from stomach acid and ensure proper absorption. Crushing or chewing these forms can destroy the enteric coating, leading to premature release, inactivation by stomach acid, and reduced effectiveness. Therefore, the patient's statement about crushing the pill indicates a need for further instruction. Options A, C, and D are correct patient understanding or appropriate lifestyle modifications.",

    "questionText": "A nurse is reviewing the medication administration record for a patient with newly diagnosed Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. The patient is prescribed insulin aspart (Novolog) and insulin glargine (Lantus). Which statement accurately describes the administration and action of these insulins that the nurse should include in patient education?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Insulin aspart should be administered once daily at bedtime to provide basal insulin coverage.",
      "B": "Insulin glargine is a rapid-acting insulin that should be taken immediately before meals.",
      "C": "Insulin aspart is a rapid-acting insulin and should be administered within 5-10 minutes before eating a meal.",
      "D": "Insulin glargine can be mixed with insulin aspart in the same syringe for convenience."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "rationale": "Insulin aspart (Novolog) is a rapid-acting insulin, which has a quick onset (10-20 minutes) and should be given immediately before meals (within 5-10 minutes) to cover the post-prandial glucose rise. Insulin glargine (Lantus) is a long-acting basal insulin, administered once daily (usually at bedtime or in the morning) to provide continuous insulin coverage, and it should *not* be mixed with other insulins (D). Therefore, option A is incorrect regarding insulin aspart, and B is incorrect regarding insulin glargine.",

    "questionText": "A patient is admitted with severe hyperthyroidism, exhibiting symptoms including extreme tachycardia (HR 130 bpm), severe agitation, high fever, and altered consciousness, indicative of a thyroid storm. Which medication, in addition to antithyroid drugs, would the nurse anticipate administering to rapidly manage the cardiovascular symptoms in this critical situation?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Levothyroxine",
      "B": "Prednisone",
      "C": "Propylthiouracil (PTU)",
      "D": "Propranolol"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "rationale": "Propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, is crucial in managing the severe sympathetic symptoms of thyroid storm, such as tachycardia, palpitations, tremors, and anxiety. It rapidly reduces heart rate and peripheral effects of thyroid hormones. Levothyroxine (A) would worsen hyperthyroidism. Prednisone (B), a corticosteroid, might be used for its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects in severe thyroid storm but does not directly address the immediate cardiovascular symptoms like a beta-blocker. PTU (C) inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis but has a slower onset of action for symptom control.",

  {
    "questionText": "A 45-year-old male patient presents with symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia, along with significant weight loss. Laboratory results reveal a fasting blood glucose of 280 mg/dL (15.5 mmol/L) and positive autoantibodies against pancreatic beta cells. Based on these findings, which type of diabetes mellitus does the nurse suspect, and what is the anticipated primary treatment modality?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus; treated primarily with oral hypoglycemic agents and lifestyle modifications.",
      "B": "Gestational Diabetes; treated with dietary management and potentially insulin during pregnancy.",
      "C": "Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus; requiring lifelong exogenous insulin replacement therapy.",
      "D": "Diabetes Insipidus; managed with desmopressin and fluid balance."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "rationale": "The presence of classic '3 Ps' (polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia), unexplained weight loss, significantly elevated fasting blood glucose, and, critically, positive autoantibodies against pancreatic beta cells, are hallmarks of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. This autoimmune destruction leads to absolute insulin deficiency, necessitating lifelong exogenous insulin replacement therapy. Type 2 Diabetes (A) involves insulin resistance and progressive beta-cell dysfunction, typically without autoantibodies and often managed initially with oral agents. Gestational Diabetes (B) occurs during pregnancy. Diabetes Insipidus (D) is a disorder of ADH, not blood glucose.",

    "questionText": "A nurse is preparing to administer an intravenous potassium chloride (KCl) infusion to a patient with severe hypokalemia. The ordered dose is 40 mEq in 1000 mL of 0.9% NaCl to be infused over 4 hours. Before initiating the infusion, which critical nursing intervention is paramount for patient safety?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Ensure the patient has adequate urine output.",
      "B": "Administer the infusion rapidly to correct the deficit quickly.",
      "C": "Mix the KCl with dextrose 5% in water to prevent irritation.",
      "D": "Monitor the patient's blood pressure every 15 minutes during infusion."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "rationale": "Before administering intravenous potassium, it is paramount to ensure the patient has adequate urine output. If the kidneys are not functioning properly and unable to excrete potassium, rapid infusion can lead to dangerous hyperkalemia, which can cause fatal cardiac arrhythmias. Potassium is excreted by the kidneys, so urine output is a direct indicator of renal function. Rapid infusion (B) is contraindicated due to cardiac risks. Mixing with dextrose (C) is often done, but it's not the paramount safety concern before starting the infusion. While blood pressure (D) is monitored, potential hyperkalemia leading to arrhythmias is the most critical and immediate risk, which is directly related to renal function.",

    "questionText": "A patient with newly diagnosed Addison's disease is receiving patient education from the nurse. Which statement made by the patient indicates a need for further teaching regarding their condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "“I will need to take hormone replacement medication for the rest of my life.”",
      "B": "“I should carry an emergency injection of hydrocortisone with me at all times.”",
      "C": "“I might experience symptoms like weight gain, moon face, and high blood sugar.”",
      "D": "“I need to increase my sodium intake, especially during hot weather or strenuous activity.”"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "rationale": "Addison's disease is characterized by *adrenal insufficiency*, meaning hyposecretion of cortisol and aldosterone. Therefore, a patient with Addison's disease would experience symptoms like weight loss, hypotension, hyponatremia, and fatigue, not weight gain, moon face, and high blood sugar, which are characteristic of Cushing's syndrome (excess cortisol). Options A, B, and D are correct teaching points for Addison's disease: lifelong hormone replacement is necessary, an emergency hydrocortisone injection is vital for adrenal crisis, and increased sodium intake helps manage aldosterone deficiency.",

    "questionText": "A 68-year-old patient with a history of hypertension is prescribed lisinopril. During a follow-up visit, the patient reports a new onset, persistent, dry cough that is particularly bothersome. The nurse recognizes this symptom as a common side effect of which class of antihypertensive medications, necessitating a potential change in therapy?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Beta-blockers",
      "B": "Calcium Channel Blockers",
      "C": "Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors",
      "D": "Thiazide Diuretics"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "rationale": "A persistent, dry cough is a well-known and common side effect of ACE inhibitors, such as lisinopril. This cough is thought to be mediated by the accumulation of bradykinin, which is normally broken down by ACE. It is often a reason for patients to discontinue ACE inhibitors and switch to an alternative antihypertensive, such as an Angiotensin Receptor Blocker (ARB), which does not typically cause this cough. Other classes of medications listed do not commonly cause this specific cough.",

      "C": "Abdomen",
      "D": "Posterior aspect of the upper arm",
      "E": "Thigh"
    },
    "correctAnswer": ["C", "D", "E"],
    "rationale": "Subcutaneous injection sites for insulin include areas with sufficient subcutaneous fat. The most common and preferred sites due to consistent absorption are the abdomen (avoiding a 2-inch radius around the navel), the posterior aspect of the upper arms (triceps area), and the thighs. The buttocks can also be used. Deltoid muscle (A) and ventrogluteal muscle (B) are typically sites for intramuscular injections, not subcutaneous injections.",

      "C": "Liver enzymes (ALT, AST) and Creatine Kinase (CK)",
      "D": "Serum potassium and sodium levels"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "rationale": "Statins, such as atorvastatin, can cause myopathy (muscle pain and weakness) and, rarely, rhabdomyolysis, which is severe muscle breakdown. These conditions are monitored by checking Creatine Kinase (CK) levels. Additionally, statins have the potential for hepatotoxicity, requiring regular monitoring of liver enzymes (ALT and AST). Options A, B, and D are relevant laboratory tests for other conditions or medications but not the primary monitoring parameters for statin-induced muscle and liver damage.",

      "A": "Acute post-surgical pain due to its strong analgesic properties.",
      "B": "Neuropathic pain, such as diabetic neuropathy or postherpetic neuralgia.",
      "C": "Inflammatory pain, like that associated with rheumatoid arthritis.",
      "D": "Opioid-induced hyperalgesia as a direct opioid antagonist."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "rationale": "Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant medication primarily used off-label for the treatment of neuropathic pain, which is pain arising from nerve damage. Examples include diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia (shingles pain), and certain types of fibromyalgia. It is not indicated for acute surgical pain, inflammatory pain, or as an opioid antagonist.",

    "options": {
      "A": "Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder characterized by hyposecretion of thyroid hormones.",
      "B": "Patients with Graves' disease often experience weight gain, cold intolerance, and bradycardia.",
      "C": "Graves' disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism and may present with exophthalmos and heat intolerance.",
      "D": "The primary treatment for Graves' disease involves lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "rationale": "Graves' disease is indeed an autoimmune disorder and the most common cause of hyperthyroidism, where the immune system stimulates the thyroid gland to produce excessive thyroid hormones. Characteristic symptoms include weight loss, heat intolerance, tachycardia, nervousness, and often exophthalmos (bulging eyes) and goiter. Option A is incorrect as it involves hypersecretion. Option B describes hypothyroidism. Option D describes the treatment for hypothyroidism.",

      "B": "Hypertensive Crisis",
      "C": "Acute Adrenal Insufficiency (Addisonian Crisis)",
      "D": "Thyroid Storm"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "rationale": "Long-term corticosteroid therapy suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, leading to atrophy of the adrenal cortex and decreased endogenous cortisol production. During times of significant stress, such as major surgery, the body requires an increased cortisol response. If exogenous corticosteroids are not sufficiently increased or if abruptly discontinued, the patient can develop acute adrenal insufficiency (Addisonian crisis), a life-threatening condition characterized by severe hypotension, hypoglycemia, and shock. This necessitates 'stress-dose' steroids. DKA, hypertensive crisis, and thyroid storm are not direct risks of long-term corticosteroid use and surgery in this context.",
