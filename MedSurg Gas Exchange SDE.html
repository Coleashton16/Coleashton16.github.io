ABGs show pH 7.29, PaCO2 58, PaO2 62, HCO3 29. The client is anxious and using accessory muscles. Which nursing action is the highest priority?",

            "B": "Increase the oxygen flow rate to 6 L/min via nasal cannula.",

        "rationale": "This client is in acute-on-chronic respiratory failure (acidosis, hypoxia, hypercapnia despite O2) and is showing signs of respiratory muscle fatigue. The priority is to support ventilation and reduce the work of breathing. BiPAP will provide inspiratory and expiratory pressure to improve alveolar ventilation, correct hypoxia and hypercapnia, and rest the respiratory muscles. While antibiotics are crucial, they will not immediately correct the gas exchange failure. Increasing O2 on a COPD retainer could blunt the respiratory drive further. Sedating the client with lorazepam is dangerous and could lead to respiratory arrest.",

            "D": "A client with a suspected pulmonary embolism who has new-onset stridor and restlessness."

        "rationale": "Stridor is a high-pitched, harsh sound indicating a severe upper airway obstruction, which is a medical emergency that can lead to complete airway closure. While the other clients have significant issues, an acute airway obstruction is the most immediate threat to life (Airway, Breathing, Circulation). The COPD client is stable for their condition. The asthma client is improving (wheezes on expiration only is better than both inspiratory and expiratory). The post-op client's pain needs management but is not as life-threatening as an airway obstruction.",

This leads to: 1) Increased permeability, allowing fluid and proteins into the alveoli (C); 2) Damage to type II pneumocytes, which stops surfactant production, causing atelectasis (A); and 3) The combination of cellular debris and plasma proteins forming a waxy hyaline membrane that blocks gas exchange (D). Mucus hypersecretion is characteristic of bronchitis. Air trapping is characteristic of COPD. Bronchoconstriction is characteristic of asthma.",

        "rationale": "A tension pneumothorax causes a mediastinal shift, pushing the trachea away from the affected side. The successful re-expansion of the lung by the chest tube relieves this pressure, allowing the trachea and other structures to return to their normal midline position. This is the most definitive sign that the life-threatening complication has been resolved. Continuous bubbling indicates an air leak. Absence of tidaling may mean the lung has re-expanded, but it could also mean there is a kink in the tubing. Subcutaneous emphysema is a complication.",

Administering a high concentration of oxygen (50%) can suppress this hypoxic drive, leading to severe hypoventilation and respiratory arrest. The goal for such clients is to maintain an SaO2 of around 88-92% using the lowest possible FiO2. A Venturi mask is used to deliver precise, low-flow concentrations (like 24-31%), making the 50% setting inappropriate and dangerous without close monitoring and likely ventilatory support.",
